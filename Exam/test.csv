0,3,"So Lila and Hunter come together under - odd circumstances. Lila tries to stall the coming together and Im actually glad that Hunter said no because after all a deal is a deal and if she didnt think through what she was getting herself into then she shouldnt have agreed. Lila was so angry at Hunter but at the end of the day she agreed so control your anger and stop your bantering. Then all of a sudden she finally decides to accept the fact that she wants him and Im confused as to why the sudden change? Even Hunter questioned it! I also didnt understand why Hunter was such a jerk about letting her go, it's not like she wasnt going to see her dad after the agreement was over - why not end it amiably if he thought she didnt feel the same way about him? I actually didnt mind the angry sex and whatnot - and to be fair there is a warning about this so if you as a reader are put off by this then do not read this book. Overall though I thought the book was just ok - no romance - no depth really (talking about why you are the way you are in a few pages isnt enough - especially so easily). However, this contemporary take on beauty and the beast wasnt bad at all but it did have the potential to be better."
1,5,"I loved this part of this series.  I just wish it had been longer and I hope there will be more someday.  The only problem I had with this book is that words were missing in some sentences and it was very obvious.  I'll miss the characters in this series if no more are ever written in it.  They were all very well rounded and real to me.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  I am also pleased to say that this book had chapter demarcations.  It makes it so much easier to know how close you are to the end of a chapter or find a stopping place if you need to do so.  If you liked the previous books in this short series, I think you should definitely read this one.  Have at it!  Give it a shot because I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2,4,"Some editing issues and odd word usage... also a little contrived and heavy handed in spots.That said, despited a feeling of redundancy, I very much enjoyed this bundle as well as the fourth book, Dark Wolf Rising.HOT! HOT! HOT! Even if most of it is all tease! lolThese stories definitely got my motor running.I liked the characters, and the sub-plot running throughout the four books (though it was less of a factor in the fourth book.)The resistance/aversion push/pull is an effective device but I would have liked a bit more variation. One slightly annoying feature was how often a character decided to &#34;Go for it&#34; only to NOT go for it shortly thereafter.Still... I enjoyed them."
3,4,This was a super cute story and was well written...for a free novel I couldnt ask for better. I am pleased to say that they are a few free ones that I have really liked which shocked me so I started looking or more and even though I read thru the whole book in 3 hours it was worth every min.
4,3,"I  liked to compare these tales with the tales of other countries, much similarity, but different characters.  Educational in that sense."
5,4,"This author rarely disappoints me.  Of all the Naughty Games books, I wanted to read this one the most.  And it was worth it.Rich boy Shane Oxley has it bad for Paige Reyes.  They'd been great friends in college along with their group of five other best friends.  And had remained great fiends even years later.  But Paige had gotten engaged and Shane had to act fast to make sure she didn't get married.But he miscalculated -- badly.  And their one night of passion ended  -- badly.  Paige has been avoiding him and their once close friendship has gone down the toilet.Now on the occasion of his birthday party, Shane had maneuvered his close group of friends to his home for some truth telling and relationship repairing.  His shamelessly uses his power to get Paige back into his orbit and maybe, just maybe,  he can dare her give him another chance.Shane was cute and so determined. Paige was hurt and so in love.  This was a two-character book.  Just the two of them hashing out their issues with some great dialogue and smoking hot love scenes.Sometimes that is all you need."
6,4,"This one was not as good as all her others, but I still enjoyed the read.  It's one of 3 (I believe)  starring the same group of people.I thought it was sad that Tony spent all that time pining for Constance and she didn't remember who he was.  I think anyone who likes regency romance or books by her will enjoy this one.  Money well spent."
7,3,"""I'm a left-leaning organic farming peacenik, and you're a dedicated member of the military-industrial complex.""Soleil Freeman and West Morgan had a brief affair five months ago. Although they heated up the sheets, their short lived liaison was more notable for the fighting. Now, months later, Soleil is noticeably pregnant and still in semi denial. A child had never been in her game plan. Added to that, she is struggling with exactly how to (whether to) tell West. He is a Special Forces officer in the Air Force and has been back at his base in Colorado since their last and, as it turns out, most consequential encounter.But surprise! West has come back to town to take care of his father who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and he runs into a Soleil who has some explaining to do.After I read this book I was both very impressed and profoundly disappointed. I think my disappointment comes from the fact that this was a nice read, but there was a great read struggling to get out. There was so much here that the reader could sink their teeth into and, unfortunately, none of it got the treatment it deserved.This book touched on the following: political identity & idealism, divorce, single parenthood v. marriage, how children view their parents and vice/versa, the ways in which children internalize parental expectations, and how love works with all of these.I think the cover of the book is so incredibly misleading. It is not some bubbly tale of a secret baby. Soleil's pregnancy and her reconnection with West is the main story, but the subplots and secondary characters are very vital and interesting in the story and are much deeper than the cover implies. And therein lies my biggest problem. I was incredibly engrossed in West's struggle with dealing with the twin blows of impending fatherhood and the fact that his larger than life father was going through terrifying bouts of dementia. I was equally drawn in by Julia's, West's mother's, re-entry into the dating world (she and West's father have been divorced for many years) and the wonderful new guy she meets. And I was incredibly intrigued by the very prickly, yet fascinating relationship Soilel has with her famous, idiosyncratic mother. BTW, I loved Soleil's background -- her hippie, down with the establishment middle class white-bread mother becomes a radical and hooks up with a Black Panther who himself later becomes establishment thereby dooming that relationship. Lol. Soleil's mother is a One woman character play waiting to happen.SO when the book ends with only West and Soleil's relationship sewn up, I felt like I was cut adrift. Even the resolution of West and Soleil's relationship wasn't completely satisfactory. It seemed so incredibly rushed. The two of them were coming from fundamentally different places. I never felt the two of them came together adequately for each other. Sure they pledge their love, but it is a Harlequin, you expect that. I didn't completely feel it. Don't get me wrong, the author creates a great connect between the two but she really needed more pages to explore it more.And that is the crux of the issue for me. I think this book needed a good 100 to 200 more pages to really satisfy me. The writing here was very good and the characters were excellent. I simply needed more time with them."
8,5,Loved all the books. I am officially a resident now. Love all my neighbors. Can relate to Charlotte the most.
9,5,THIS IS AN EDGE OF YOUR SEAT JOY RIDE THROUGH zombie land! Will be buying the rest of these books soon! Hope the superior of Og  is as interesting as it sounds.
10,4,"This ebook was supplied to me free to read and review.This book grabbed me from the first page, although the plot is unlikely, to put it mildly, where everyone can seemingly be bought if the price is right. Eric the main character by an initial misfortune gets involved with drug smuggling and as his daughter is threatened he has no choice but to continue. Eric works his way up the drug smuggling organisation and although extreme violence and high body count the violence is almost so over the top that it just adds to the atmosphere rather than shocks. All of the characters are well developed and the plot is quite straightforward although there is a twist at the end it again does not seem likely.Summary an action packed book where you have to suspend belief but very readable with some good ideas. If you like smuggling, gang warfare, murders and extortion you will like this."
11,4,"This author can write an absolutely scorching sex scene. If you don't want a very erotic romance, don't pick up this book. And along with this hot sexiness, the author also gives us a sweet romance.So you know the main story- girl wins lottery and falls for her financial planner. What you don't know is that the girl is afraid to love. I won't tell you why specifically, but she does have reasons for how she feels about love, relationships, and men in general. Her motto is keep things clean and neat and no one gets hurt.Brittney treats men as disposable playthings. She owns her sexuality and has no qualms about having fun, hot sex flings. Because of her past, Brittney's relationships with men are more hormonal rather than emotional. She reduces them to basic need; there is no love or tenderness, no expectation of tomorrow. She does not date and does not know what a 'normal' relationship with a man would even look like.Enter our hero, Charlie, who is nice, normal, solid and hot as hell. I'd call him a sexy geek. He's a tall, fit number cruncher with dark hair and eyes and these cute wire-rimmed glasses. And Brittney drives him crazy. They are so opposite, but the attraction between them builds and builds. Without really understanding the why or how of this sexual chemistry between them, they decide to let the attraction play out, but only as a quickie here and there.This is more at Brittney's insistence. She's so afraid to feel anything but lust for a man. Mention love and she's out the door. But poor Charlie, he's a man ready for a commitment, for happily ever after. He wants a woman to take care of and to spend the rest of his life with. And he's determined to make Brittney see things his way.I just loved Charlie! Even that solid, stand-by-you name of his. Every woman deserves a Charlie. I could just kiss him. He is so patient with Brittney. He really gentles her, quiets her fears, and treats her like something special.And let's not forget that hot sex. Sex in the office, sex in a public restroom, more sex in the office, and then lastly, a very tender but sexy scene as love words are finally confessed.This is a novella, but it is packed with a sweet love story and some HOT sex. I really enjoyed it; I loved both characters a lot. Brittney thinks to seduce Charlie into a fast, no strings affair, but it is Charlie who seduces Brittney into accepting the love of one good, true man.There are books about Britt's two best friends as well-Book 2Fortune's Promise: : Fortune, Book 2Book 3Fortune's Chance: : Fortune, Book 3"
12,5,I have read all of Mrs. Jackson's books I love here Westmoreland men. This was awesome because I got 4 books for $10
13,5,"The author brings to the forefront the question of asking ourselves the question, ""Are we doing all we can to obtain a better life?"" The seven steps lays out a plan of action to take on a daily bases for self improvement. A better you, creates a better life experience. Recommend this read."
14,5,"An interesting mix of mystery and magic, with an unassuming "" Light house keepers wife dropped into a many layered quest to find her husband who disappeared while on a secret mission for the governor. Where to start?, who can she trust?, and who is shadowing her, and why?. A pleasant read, well worth the time."
15,5,"Dale nails it once again with this shot at fatherhood. I was well reminded of my own, continuing foibles as a parent, both good and bad. It's great to know I'm not the only fool out there who is living a life worthy of laughter more often than tears. Thanks, Dale!"
16,4,Good book. Cathy Maxwell writes superb love stories. Never boring. Recommended. I gave it four stars for a HEA ending
17,1,"Horrible, plastic characters. I know we are supposed to find Aggie quirky and unconventional but she comes across as annoying and self-obsessed. I won't be finishing and am very glad it was free."
18,5,"I really loved this book. Without spoiling it, this book is so worth it. I really enjoyed reading it, it had me sad and crying on some parts. Love the relationship of Z and Bella. Was so happy of the turn out of Z with his daughter Nalla. Wish to read more of this family."
19,5,"Aiden McKaslin, a widow, and Joanna Nelson with two children to raise by herself lived different lives trying to get by.  Aiden could not forget his dead wife and Joanna just tried to keep a roof over her childrens heads by doing the right things. Love was hard earned and was a struggle until an almost tragic event. Good read."
20,5,"Hurray! A short story that is not just a lead-in to another book to buy!Chloe is a shy retiring school teacher, whose dating experience is extremely limited. Her twin sister, Zoe, is identical in appearance, but her complete opposite in personality. Chloe is shocked to learn that Zoe's luxurious life style is not due to a career as a financial wizard, but rather her skill as a dominatrix. Zoe, it seems, has always been able to talk Chloe into anything, and when she talks Chloe into taking her place for her next appointment, Chloe's in for a life changing experience.I liked this story. The idea was unique, if unbelievable. But, hey, it's fiction! I also wanted to know how the hero became so knowledgeable in the ways of pleasing a woman, but maybe he was just well-read.For a short, free read, I recommend it, as long as you are a fan of erotic romance."
21,5,"You don't have to be in a declared war to be wounded! D.J. had a severe trauma in her childhood that left her in emotional pain and paralyzed with fear of trusting anyone, especially men. Quinn is recovering from a muffed assignment as an assassin for the government. Can both find healing in each other?Enjoy this emotional story that is spiced with the humor Susan Mallery always adds."
22,1,"Great premise, really enjoyed the free sample.  Sadly that was the best part of the book.  There were no descriptions, no charachter development - just names of ""the crew"".  I couldn't keep straight who was doing what as they were all interchangable.  This is an extremely short story and there is no plot either.  Very disappointing."
23,1,"Yuck, yuck and more yuck.  Not what I expected and nothing that I would consider reading.  Too much sex and not enough substance."
24,4,"Paul's one act of youthful self-indulgence was to marry Jo, only to be persuaded to give her up for her own safety and allow her to think him dead, but when his sacrifice fails to keep her safe six years later, he forces his way back into her life determined to keep her this time. I wasn't always sure I liked Paul, but I didn't dislike him, so I found myself willing to give him a chance based on Jo's past regard for him. Jo, I loved! She had crawled out from her grief and became an amazingly strong female character, as a deputy marshal, able to hold her own amongst the military world that Paul drug her into. She was no damsel waiting for her knight to save her. I found the mystical attraction between Jo and Paul a bit over the top, but didn't think it detracted from the story too much. I enjoyed the interaction between Jo and her guards. The ending almost seems to invite a sequel and I wouldn't mind reading Nolan or Tait's story. All in all, good read!"
25,4,"If you are quite like me and love all things talismanic, symbolic and/or esoteric, you will find this a worthy addition to your collection.The first part of the book is what I really consider the meat and potatoes - here, you will find pictures of the described talismans and some brief and thoroughly interesting dialogue on their known origins and meanings.  I found the Kindle version a bit cumbersome, though.  Even though the text is nicely linked to it's corresponding page of diagrams, once on the page of diagrams, it is up to the reader to navigate back to the referencing page of text.The second section of the book is devoted to astrology and a given sign's gem/s, notable sign characteristics, likely career endeavors, love matches, etc.  I found this section to be a disappointing departure from it's earlier material.  That said, it was somewhat interesting (though not new) and while I could surely argue it's inclusion, I find the whole thing would have gone off much more to my liking with the astrological section omitted.I knocked a star for the cumbersome nature of the Kindle version and for the awkward inclusion of astrological/zodiacal signs.  That said, I'm a fanatic of all things regarding symbology and have added the paperback version of this book to my wish list - I liked the early talismanic material enough that this book will be going into my permanent collection."
26,4,"I borrowed this ebook from my public library.I enjoyed this second book in the series more than the first. I think the characters were better developed, and I enjoyed the storyline more. It caught my interest early on and this time around kept me turning the pages. I think the story had more going on and it just made more sense. You see more magick, more murder, and more getting to know some of our favorite characters.I said I would try this book out to see if I would continue with the series and I am happy I did. I plan on checking out the 3rd book soon."
27,4,It's great having some games on your Kindle. Reading is fantastic but your eyes do need a break once in awhile.
28,3,"Friends since childhood, co-business owners, and tricked into a risqu&eacute; game of daring sex, so now it's time to face their love...the four or them."
29,4,"Despite the corny feel of that game, gay chicken?, this book was definitely worth a read. And a re-read. Maybe even a third. Because that's how hot these two guys were together. Also, the attraction didn't feel forced. I thought it flowed perfectly :)Fakkit, I'll probably read it a fourth time, too."
30,2,"This book is about a community of witches(or persons with magic powers) who begin to lose select members to a murderer. It's a decent plot, the characters are likeable, and the steamy scenes are hot enough, but it becomes way to simplistic in the end. It turns into a bad Scooby-Doo episode were the murderer steps forward and explains all there reasons and then is just taken away....umm yawn boring. There are some confusing paragraphs off and on where you don't know who is talking and who they are referring too otherwise the author can put together a decent sentence. It's mediocre I would be willing to try another book from this author but don't expect a lot. It was a fast read a couple of hours at most."
31,5,"At first, I didn't want to read this book because I was so tired of the same ole story line but once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down....It really kept my attention and I really enjoyed it...what a way to sway away from the same ole same ole...I can't wait to read the others."
32,3,"When I picked this book up I expected a romance story with very steamy sex.  It was that...but this reader felt that both the romance and the sex were okay but not great.  The heroine obviously had feelings for him but they only seemed to be brought out during sex...otherwise the interaction didn't feel genuine.  As for the hero, did he want her as a loving partner and soulmate or did he want to just dominate her?  I thought the former until the last sex scene...did he take her in that manner for love or for control?  If that was the intent of the author, then I say good job, but left me scratching my head wondering what was the point of this?"
33,5,This is the ultimate vampire encounter!! Once I began reading I was thoroughly hooked and had to finish reading as quickly as I could. This book is SCARY GOOD!!
34,4,I loved this book it fit so good into the series and am looking forward to the next. HOT HOT HOT!!!
35,4,"I bought this novel some time ago and it's been sitting in my kindle gathering edust ever since.  When I buy the next book, I won't make that same mistake.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable read and some really fun spaceopera.The universe designed for this story involves evil galactic empires, aliens, seedy starports, FTL and talented heroes.  To that degree, it's no different than the rest of the novels in this sub-genre.  The hook is Harper's creation of the Silent who are able to enter a dreamscape and use it to talk across intra-galactic distances.If you're looking for science fiction that makes great socio-political statements, this is not the place for you.  But, if you want to kick back with a fun story and let the author entertain you, then by all means, read this book."
36,5,"And when you fall for a gambling man sometime you can come  out winning the pot...in this case a hot chocolatier's wish is her gamble and she stands to win the lottery of lust and love.  Hot, steamy, sexy, oh-la-la!!"
37,4,I you want a good porn story...this is it. If you want lovey dove..this is not it!  fast paced and gets to the point and will get your engine going. Not for the faint of heart or someone who is not open minded!
38,5,"Character Witness is not part of the other 'Witness Series' books by the same author, but just as engaging. The characters all come to life and the twists and turns to the storyline will keep you up late trying to figure it out.Buzzbar: You must have gotten an unedited early release on this, it appears to have been reposted without the errors. Try it again, you'll enjoy it."
39,5,"I like shifter alien romance stories with a dominate male and a strong, but submissive female This story had it all, including hot sex scenes and a little intrigue, plus the promise of more to come in future books."
40,5,"For any Lincoln fan, this is a must read.  It is short and very easy to read but a really, really good addition to your library."
41,5,"Great story, really enjoyed te chemistry between Wesley and Carrie. Highly recommend. I'm from ga. So it was nice to read this story based on the rich history of georgia. Very well written"
42,5,"Bound by Deception was an unlucky book in my reading list, it slipped day by day till the day I almost forgot I had it, and now that I read it, thanks to the release of a sequel, I'd like to knock myself on the head for allowing so. I knew that I would have liked it, I loved another book by Ava March, an Erotic Regency as this one, so why I waited so much? Mystery of my strange mind...Anyway, Ava March, in this second book, but really her first book, confirms my previous idea of her: she is a very good erotic writer, but above all she is a very good Regency romance writer. Not Traditional Regency, it's obvious, but as many writers of the genre are saying, the Traditional Regency romance genre is languishing, and so welcome to a bit of fuzzy borders, with Mystery, Erotica and even Vampires! And yippie yippie yeah, the M/M Regency Romance! And don't worry, in Bound by Deception you will not find a damsel in distress disguised by in gentleman clothes, the men in it are both men, only that one happens to like to be a bottom, and the other one is a total top... but preferably on top of a man!Oliver and Vincent had one thing in common, both second sons of the aristocracy, they met at boarding school. They became best friends, even if Oliver really never understood what Vincent found in him: even if second son, Vincent was from a wealthy family and he had chances that Oliver never had: a superior education, a small inheritance that he made thriving and above all a fine appearance and a bearing that Oliver total lacked. Despite this Vincent still considers Oliver one of his best friends, even if with the parameters of the time: a man he is comfortable with, with whom he likes to chat at the club, and a friendly ear that comprehends his striven to try to always please his father, a man that has never even acknowledged his presence in the room, since he has just the heir he needs. Actually I wondered how good the author was, creating a whole family environment for Vincent, without actually presenting any of the members of it, if not as names and outline shadows without cue, and at the same time rendering the desolation of Oliver's life, of whom we never once, neither in his youth memories, meet someone of his family. All Oliver's world turns around Vincent, since the day they met as children, and in the end, Oliver has to do something.Other than being neglected second sons, Oliver and Vincent have something else in common, they prefer the company of men. But where Oliver admitted with himself who he is and what he likes, maybe since he likes to be on the bottom, and it's difficult from that perspective deny it, Vincent is still cheating himself with the lie that, since he is on the top, he is not really a sodomite; it's quite a weak excuse, but then, he has to use it only with himself, since never once Vincent shared his segret with Oliver. And Oliver happens to know it only since they frequent the same brothel and the same whore inside it. The deeply knowledge Oliver has of Vincent and his love for him, made the man able to recognize him in the words of the whore and now Oliver has a plan: for one night he will be in the place of the whore and he will finally have the night he wants with Vincent, without loosing their friendship... and here maybe is the only problem I had with the book, since I don't believe that a three days beard, long hair and the absence of the glass he usually wears, is enough to Oliver to not being recognize by Vincent. To excuse the author there is also to say that we are used to modern electric lights, and instead in that time there were candles and firelight, and plus Vincent is not absolutely expecting to find Oliver in the man he payed for sex.This is only a novella, but it's a finely built novella, and I'm really happy to know that there is a sequel, even if, for once, I didn't find it lacking: all the pages and scenes were properly weighted and in the end, you had the feeling to read a longer book. A sequel will only add more and welcome details to a nice story."
43,5,"Wow...this is a fantasy come to life. I could dream about being in Kate's place for days to come. Kate's Crew is a hot little read, just what you need to warm you up on these snowy cold days. Way to knock another one out of the park Ms. Rylon!"
44,2,"I've collected about 100 Kindle complete works now.  Sadly, this was one of the 3 worst.The main killer for this collection -- Monospace font.  The whole collection is in a large, unchangable font.  Also, there are no marker bars between stories or chapters (active table of contents).If the font was fixed, I'd add a star.As for the writing, this is Dickens.  Five stars for the content."
45,4,"Madeline `Maddie' Carpenter's life hasn't changed since she won the lottery one year ago along with her best friends Brittney and Lauren.  Rather than go on a spending binge she still lives in the same house, works the same job, and hasn't indulged in anything life altering that most people who play the lottery dream of doing.  Her life is very ordinary - at least it was until the evening of Brittney's wedding when Maddie dares to step out of her comfort zone and accept the wedding reception singer's not so subtle offer to visit his hotel room.Tanner Robinson is a singing superstar who just happens to occasionally agree to do private performances.  He's agreed to sing at Brittney's reception but there's a tinge of resentment in doing so since all his love songs were written for his ex-wife, who'd left him for a woman.  He'd just received his final divorce papers the day before and that just adds to his discontent and frustration.  Mindless sex has been a great way to alleviate his restlessness - and he goes looking for just that when he enters the hotel bar and propositions Maddie.Maddie isn't like any of the women Tanner's been photographed with or use to for that matter.  She's not `Hollywood,' she's real - no flashy clothes, rabbit food diet, and no ulterior motive for sharing time with him.  He might have gone looking for a one night fling, but what he found is a woman he can't resist - and he honestly isn't sure how he feels about that.  One thing's certain, even once he returns to his normally busy recording schedule he can't stop thinking about her.  Maddie carries her own insecurities but she's willing to risk her heart for Tanner, but is she prepared for the pretentious world of a popular singer?  What about Tanner... can he let go of his ex-wife's betrayal and find a happily-ever-after with a woman who's paralyzed with fear of changing anything in her life?Who hasn't dreamed of the changes they'd make in their lives if they could just pick those lucky numbers?  Now imagine if you actually did win but making any of those changes is just too overwhelming.  Karen Erickson's FORTUNE'S PROMISE provides readers with just such a scenario and throws in a newly divorced popular singer just to complicate matters - the results are decidedly entertaining and highly memorable.  As a reader I found it very easy to relate to Maddie and her discomfort with change but loved that she steps out of her comfort zone with Tanner for an undeniably naughty night.  FORTUNE'S PROMISE is a beautiful story of two people moving past their fears, letting go of their pasts and embracing the possibilities of a future together.  It's definitely a story that just makes you feel good about life in general - even if you don't win the lottery.I confess I haven't read the other titles in the FORTUNE's series so obviously the books can be read as stand alones but I'm definitely curious enough about Brittney and Lauren that I'll be picking up copies of the other stories soon.  Here are the titles in the FORTUNE series in order:FORTUNE'S DECEPTIONFORTUNE'S PROMISEFORTUNE'S CHANCEOr if you prefer your books in print format pick up a copy of LUCK OF THE DRAW which contains all three of the FORTUNE stories.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
46,5,"I really adored this very sweet story of a man coming home again and finding all his dreams can come true. I truly felt for Ryan as no one should have to go through what he did in the four years after his parents threw him out. The fact that he got up the courage to return for his sister's wedding told me so much about the kind of man he was. This was the first Serena Yates book I read but I don't think it will be the last.When Ryan got up his courage to tell his parents he was gay, they told him it was a sin and he would burn in hell for it. They threw him out and threatened his friends if he tried to get help from anyone. Ryan lived on the streets, he headed to Canada and has just barely made ends meet trying to stay away. He discovers his twin sister, Nicole, is marrying his best friend, Peter, and even though Ryan is terrified they hate him and want nothing to do with him, he has to see his sister on her wedding day.Daniel, Peter's older brother, can't believe his eyes when he finds Ryan on a park bench the night before the wedding. He looked so hard for Ryan when he disappeared, not believing his parents who said he ran away. Daniel, Peter and Ryan were always inseparable, regardless of the five year age difference, but the last few years before Ryan left, Daniel started to feel more. Can he convince Ryan to stay and make a life with him, because Daniel isn't going to lose him again.This is a fairly short story but well worth the read. It is sweet with just the right amount of angst and the two main characters are very lovable men. Now I'm looking for more!"
47,3,"I liked this story. I liked Nash and thought Stacy was aiiight - Thought the way that Tressie Lockwood told the story was good. I think maybe I would have liked it more if it was a little longer - didn't care much for the way the story went on ""fast forward"". I haven't read the other books in this trilogy  - but I do like Ms. Lockwood's writing style and will probably look for more of her books. All in all, this was a pretty good read."
48,3,"Not bad for a first novel I suppose, but he really needed to run it by another editor.  There were a bunch of really annoying grammar/punctuation errors. The story was kind of one dimensional, and I don't feel like I got to know the characters as much as I'm accustomed to in this genre.  It was diverting as a free novel, but I'm not exactly anxious for the next one to come out."
49,5,This was a wonderful book and I enjoyed reading it so much. This book was a wonderful surprise and I could hardly put it down!
50,3,"How can you seriously rate this. I realize it's been split in 3but even then it's really short. I would pay for this if it was one book. This little bit isn't enough to make me buy it to read the rest.  There needs to be more to the tease to say ""I have to have it"". I do not even know anything about the characters to comment about them."
51,4,"This was my first Mari Carr book. I liked it. It was a quick, sexy BDSM read. I kind of thought that the 'love' was a bit rushed, but that happens with short stories. Its why I usually don't read novellas. This one entertained me enough though. I read it in one sitting, and enjoyed it."
52,4,"This book was fun to read. If you like military sci fi you won't go wrong. What I really liked about the book is the ""find"". I don't want to spoil it for other readers so I won't say any more. I only wish the book was longer and had a lot more story and background for this find. The core is there for this book to be great!  Maybe we could see a prequel?"
53,2,"Pull My Hair would've been a great read if the heroine would've been more likable.  She came off as shallow, paranoid and childish so much so that I slogged my way through this book and almost wished the hero would leave her.  If you must read it, if not move onto a more worthy selection."
54,3,"The simple basics of the Judeao-Christian ethic, remarkable.I can't think of another thirteen words...now five words...oh...three more  , two more...It was good to read as well as interesting"
55,3,"If you are in the market for a short story then this is it. Nice and uncomplicated, but it is a pity when the depth of the characters could have been developed so much more and a good story could have come to light. When I look for a good read I want something that lasts longer than fifty minutes."
56,2,"This was a great disappointment. Yes, it was free, at least at the time of this writing, but even free things should reach to a certain standard.The story tells the tale of a group of Sith who crash-land on a mysterious planet. They promptly start fighting against each other while worrying that they might not be rescued or, possibly worse, they might be rescued and have to explain to the uber-boss why they don't have their valuable cargo.With the characters we see in this short story, there's also no one to really root for. There's no real character development, and several of the characters have similar names, which makes keeping track of who's who rather difficult. The action is somewhat confusing and poorly written as well.All in all, this is clearly supposed to be a teaser for a larger work. That's nice and all, but when the larger work comes out, I can just download the free preview text rather than something like this. It's also worth noting that this short story does not make me at all interested in reading the larger work."
57,5,"LOL.. I loved when Jace found out that Kyle was actually Kayla. Great scene. Wonderful book. I've read all this author's books and loved every one of them. She has such a great way with words and storylines. HOWEVER, she will have to write a little faster. Can't wait for her next 100 books."
58,4,This was a sexy read with a spoilt princess and a barbarian whats not to like about that? we do have some girl on girl action in this one just fyi but overall pretty dang hot

60,5,"This was an intriguing, eventful story that captured my attention & managed to keep it through the entire book...I fell in love with the Characters & their individual stories that intermingled with the main character & the town of Bly, Kenntucky....Through all the struggles, the heroin survives...GREAT read indeed..."
61,5,"Oh wow...I just read most of this straight through and I don't even know what to say.  I need to take a minute to collect my thoughts.  It was so beautiful and so well done.  And in such an original way too.  Of course I guessed a few things before they happened, but Part 1 was so different than Part 2 of the book, and I did not expect it to go in that direction at all.  I love how it went beyond the original premise to the recovery and all.  Part 2 of the book is where it became most original.  I also loved the half and half viewpoints, I loved the two leads (and I loved the layout of the book, how you learn each character truly in turn, and then can think back and know more of their emotions from earlier scenes).  And the story became harsh, it had me tearing up there for a while...but this book really had everything.  From the sex and action and denial, to the romance and passion, pain and change, love and hope, growth and future.  It was a brilliant work like all I've read by Josh Lanyon.  Now I'll check out Laura Baumbach too.  But I know this story will stay with me.  I loved it completely. Eventually I'll reread it knowing all that I do now and I think that will only make it better.P.S. See?  This review is still all scattered because this book just kind of out my brain on another level.  So wonderful."
62,4,"Great book packed full with fast cars , crazy hot men, and danger... and oh yes great sex!"
63,4,I started reading this book and then read it every chance I had till the last page.  Imaginative plot coupled with great characters make this a worthwhile read.
64,4,This book pretty much starts off smoking hot and doesn't let up. Yes its pretty much love at first sight and sex within moments of meeting each other. But I was instantly interested in the book although the whole issue with the witch was way to easily solved.  But thankfully there is another book to this series and I hope that we will have more of Silas and Martha.
65,5,"Oh, wow. This is why I got a Kindle, to find fun new authors who write new and original stories. Dead Man's Rain is set in a gritty world where magic happens, but it's not common, where ogres live alongside humans and the occasional elf, where rich vampires hunt the night with the permission of the local authorities, and where finder Markhat has unwanted assistance in getting cases from his neighbor, the card reader Mama Hog. And then you get to the case itself . . . .Along with creating fascinating characters, the author gives a lot of little details that make the story come alive.One note, though: as other reviewers have mentioned, this is a short story/novella and not a novel.Would I reread this book? I already have.Would I spend money on this book? I would, and I did. In fact, I ended up buying all of his books, even Wistril Compleat, which is very different in tone and content.Kindle infoFormatting: Very well formatted.Length: 1452 locations (1453-1611 contain the About the Author and an excerpt from 7% and Rising)"
66,5,"A brilliant short story with twists and turns that you will not see coming. Completely engaging and engrossing, Suzi M grabs the reader by the hand and does not let go until she has led you down the garden path and there is no return.In this dark tale Lilith and Enoch have a conversation about the state of being. Black humor at it's finest. Do not miss this gem."
67,3,"Gabby and Justin were roommates for 2 years, until 6 months ago when she moved out of his house while he was in Cabo w/ some of his buddies.  He runs into her a grocery store, she tries to hide from him - she had been avoiding him.  She moved out 2 weeks after they had drank a bottle of tequila and Justin kissed her.  So they made out - then she moved out - without a word, no note - nothing.  Justin is giving up that easy, he wants Gabby - and he will do anything to convince her.  There is talk of domestic violence but, it only to develop the background plot - doesn't really play into the main story line.This is another story about how a friendship becomes more.  However, what made this a story good was the balance of emotion and detail.  This story was very short - but has impact."
68,4,"Alex Rossi aka Sean Devlin is leading a double life--he's the founder of Devlin Group as Sean Devlin; and he's Alex Rossi (his real name), one of Devlin Groups senior agents. His lifetime goal has been to find & kill the man who murdered his mother.Grace Nolan is an ex- agent, and considers Sean Devlin a friend. When her young son, Danny, is kidnapped, she's forced to ask Devlin Group to help her find & rescue him. The kidnapper just happens to be the killer Alex is seeking, and the killer knows the secret connection between Grace & Alex---Danny is Alex's son---although Alex just found that out. He's furious Grace never told him about Danny. She was furious Alex shot her just before she found out she was pregnant!!This romantic suspense book has plenty of action scenes; tense moments; great one-liners; and great secondary characters who more than likely will have their own stories; I.e., Gallagher & Carmen."
69,4,"If you want a book that will nearly singe your eyebrows off from the heated contents, this is it! I wish there had been a little more character development/plot but the sex scenes...OMG! I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it readers. Especially for those who like a MMF menage. Good job Ms. Matthews!"
70,5,"This remarkable novel follows the journey of two mind-melded companions through the dangerous landscape of a post-apocalyptic future Earth.  By healing a wolf, a mentally gifted man gains a lifelong companion who travels with him to visit legendary north-country tribes.  They meet extraordinary characters along the journey and discover a destiny that is sure to shape their future.An important destiny awaits the bonded travelers.  Will people seek out technology that nearly destroyed Earth or follow the path of nature and self-discovery?  The author's vivid descriptions of places and people takes readers into a mysterious future world filled with danger.  The journey is worth taking and the characters are worth knowing.This is the second book in the Shape Shifter series.  It can be read on its own, but the reader will get a much better experience by reading Syren Song first and then reading Melder.  The reviewer who discounted this book surely didn't understand the importance of the shape-shifters to the overall composition.  I recommend both books to anyone who loves animals and quests."
71,4,"I thought Sleepwalker: the Last Sandman was very well written and incredibly entertaining.  This indie author is bursting with talent.  I understand this is a YA book but it is tremendously enjoyable for adults as well.The story itself was interesting and fun.  It was a sort of story in a story, but did not get unnecessarily complicated or confusing.  The book takes place in two different worlds and again, it was not confusing.  Also, it was easy to envision the dream world from all the descriptions.  The characters were all fully developed and not flat or two dimensional at all.  I liked everything about this book - story, characters and their development, vivid descriptions, and great imagination.My favorite parts of the book were when Jake would tell a story.  They were captivating tales and they fit right into the story.Well done, Brad Marlowe.  I sincerely hope that there is another book in the works."
72,4,i really enjoyed this book.  i wish this book had been a little longer. looking forward to reading book 2.
73,2,"The biggest problem I had with this work was switching the names of the firms owners. In 3 circumstances she switched the name of the bad partner with the good.  How irritating.  How did this get by for 13 years.  Yes, the piece was originally released in '99 and no one caught it?  Really?  AND I agree with the other reviewer that noted how sophomoric this story was.  Maybe the point taken should have been her age. Maybe she should have been younger than 27. Anyhow, there are far better stories in this story feed than this one."
74,3,"The set-up for this story was interesting - a man called Simon is imprisoned in a mental asylum and meets Gabrielle Howell, a woman determined to save him.The plot was quite absurd but I was enjoying the book until the sex scenes started.  Now I appreciate a well-written love scene as much as the next reader but the author really went over the top with the sex in this one.  The scenes aren't badly written, they're just so frequent that I found myself wishing the characters would stop bonking each other and get on with the story.  After a while it was just seizure, bonk, repeat.Things got a bit muddled once the Rakehells made an appearance.  There were so many of them (as well as their wives!)that I started skipping over those sections.  Fans of the series, I'm sure, would find these bits interesting but it was very confusing for a new reader like me.Frequent typos throughout the book were also annoying.  This one gets two and a half stars from me."
75,1,"just not my thing.  it quickly degenerated into today's slide into slime.  It is a pity, he used to tell a good tale"
76,5,Great story. I couldn't put it down.  I cannot wait to see what happens in the next book. A good love story.
77,4,"this is a short novella and I had never read the author before but I decided to give it a try as it was free anyway. After reading it I can tell you I would have paid for the book,I enjoyed it that much.The premise of her agreeing to stay with him for a year in return for his planet protecting earth at first seems a little corny,but surprisingly the author did a good job of making it seem very real and very possible. The sex scenes were steamy and erotic,thankfully with no bsmd ,and they fit in the story perfectly,the only complaint that I have to make at all is I wanted more!!!! I wish this would have been a full length novel,rather than a novella because it was such a good read and I hated to see it end. Worth the time to read,though short may it be!!!"
78,1,"I got this book for my Kindle free; after reading I'm really glad I didn't pay anything for it. The storyline had the potential for a good ""Twilight Zone"" kind of story, but was just too lightweight to make it. The author seems to feel the need to put in really XX rated sex scenes - she seemed to love to be able to use the word c**k. I didn't find this adding anything to the story, and only finished it because it's a fairly short book."
79,5,I just loved the characters and how they were carried from high school to adult life. they were all so real.
80,3,"This book was my least favorite of the series. It was lacking detail in the beginning and the heroine's purpose seemed too manufactured to me. I also couldn't get my head wrapped around the alternating first and third person accounts chapter to chapter. The static characters were a little too static for me (there could have been a little more explanation for some of the behaviors or snootier snubs. And none of them ever really seemed to be resolved).The ending seemed a little scraped together as well. Having already read others in the series, I know this is just a fluke. I will say I liked the characters though, in better development of their back stories or resolutions I would have been more apt to give four stars. Still, it was a decent read. But not one I would be in a hurry to re-read."
81,4,"Absolutely chilling.  The fact that unstable, psychotic killers can blend into society so well is what made this story so scary for me.  The writing was fast paced, the action suspenseful, and the plot very plausible.  Dan's character and escalating instability was very well written.  I do think Melissa's character could have been fleshed out a bit more as I really didn't get a very good understanding of her.  Just when I thought the story was finished and I felt safe again, thinking Dan and Melissa could settle down into their relationship instead of running for their lives, here comes a surprising gut-punching twist that left my heart racing."
82,5,"Tucker and Micah grew up together on the Bar D ranch. They grew up like brothers. They made love the night before Tucker left the ranch for good. Of course, Tucker returned and they were able to have an adult relationship. I thought this was a terrific story about two independent, hard headed men. Where they were determined to take care of each other. The family relationships that they have was also critical to this story. This was well thought out and magnificently written. I highly recommend this book!!"
83,3,B.j. Daniels just keeps giving us great story lines with sexy cowboys and smart sassy women.  Great story to read.
84,3,"Not as good as Jimmy, along the same line though and very believable.  I enjoy getting into the head of the twisted and demented.  This was an easy read and kept my attn, but not one I thought about much after reading it.  (though I still think about Jimmy!)"
85,5,"It's not much the story that made an interesting reading of Bastards and Pretty Boys for me, but the characters. First of all, there is a countercurrent development of them, the pretty boy is the bastard and the stronger man in the relationship, and the hunky man is the one needing protection.Charles has just bought a cottage on the lake and he wants to spend a week alone and relaxing. I think Charles has his life a bit too full: a divorce and an ex-wife that wants still to lead his life, even if with good intentions (it happens when your ex-wife is a cop) and a relationship that it's not going in the direction Charles hoped. Truth be told, Charles is not exactly a perfect man who is suffering from the mistakes of other people, I didn't always like his attitude: for example with his lover's son, a kid who is suffering for the divorce of his parents, and also for the new relationship of his father with Charles, something he doesn't understand since no one cared to explain the situation to him. Charles is not sympathetic, I even felt like he was annoyed.Both Charles than Kenneth have not an easy relationship with themselves. Charles is still not at ease with being g ay, and he almost resents the fact to be too pretty, like it's a ""g ay"" birthmark; he thinks that Carolyn, his ex-wife, even if she has accepted the reason of their divorce, still doesn't like for him to be ""too"" g ay, but I think he is reflecting his own perception of the situation: it's Charles himself that doesn't want to be labelled ""g ay"" and for this reason he is all right with a relationship with Kenneth, since Kenneth doesn't seem g ay... Being with him, Charles can't pretend that he is not so g ay.Same reason why he is attracted by Booker, his neighbour: Booker doesn't seem g ay, at first Charles thinks he is straight, but despite this, he is nevertheless attracted by him. When he discovers that Booker is g ay, it's even better: not only Booker doesn't look g ay, he is mainly a bottom in bed, so that Charles is even more reassured in his masculinity. Booker seems really the perfect man, and even his past experience in prison (for marijuana detention) is not something too bothering to Charles' eyes.Truth be told, I would have been satisfied with the story like that, the crime subplot regarding Booker and his stalker felt a bit estranged, like something the author needed to add to wrap up the story. It was not bad, even if the unexpected connection between Booker and Charles was a bit too pulled, but in the end it was not what remained of the book in my mind. Probably what was more particular, and interesting, was the atmosphere of the book, there was a stilling sensation, something I associated with the lake and the place; the setting was not an hustle and bustle holiday location, it was more like sleeper little town. Actually the whole neighbouring thing with Charles spying Booker and Booker suddenly appearing, was even a little creepy; in the end the story is more simple than what the growing expectations made you believe, but that was exactly what made the story interesting and original."
86,4,This story tells about two people who could never get over their first and last encounter.  Though it is supercharged with sex it also lets you see how two people who never believed in love at first come to know that what they have is not something that should be tossed away.
87,4,"Yummy cowboy menage!!! Really enjoyed this book and all the delicious bondage play!Super steamy action, good lord girl, you'll need a shower! I do love a smexy menage scene!The story was thin but still enjoyable. I would have liked more but in the end it was a nice ride!"
88,5,"This book is amazing. U have to read this book. It starts out sad, but has the best ending. You. May cry a little. But the tears are worthwhile book. The best ending. One of the best books I have read."
89,2,"This is it, the big kahuna of financial newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles, no emailing articles to a friend, no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So, if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
90,4,"I turn to this book when I need something sexy. It is sex, sex, and more sex. The other reviewers are right, there is little plot or character development. But not all stories have to have a fully developed story. It is what it is. Like the story &#34;Caged Slave&#34;, everything is going fine until the nervous uke jumps to conclusions. Everything is fine again once they talk. Of course if they are talking openly of their feelings there would be no plot at all. I say just sit back and relax and enjoy the sex. After all I have yet to read a novel from Japan that doesn't have plot holes the size of tanker trucks."
91,3,It is a very erotic book. I wasn't expecting it but was pleasantly surprised by th  storyline. Was it earth in the future I don't know. I wish they had more backstory on Caralon.
92,3,"I found this story to be a nice read, but fairly predictable as to the directions of the characters. I would like to have had more build-up with the characters & more excitement with the direction they took. Because of the lack of this, the characters seemed weak & flitty, not exactly what you expect from uber-alphas. Other than that, good read."
93,4,"This is a promising author and this is a good read, no doubt about it. An otherwise good reading experience is a bit marred by quite a few spelling and grammer errors. Also there is an error in the author's rendition of the so-called ""safety"" system of a Glock pistol. All Glocks have a somewhat unique ""safety"" that does not require turning or clicking something on or off, and the editor should have caught this. These defects do detract a bit from the authenticity of the story. However I do look forward to more from this author, hopefully with better editing."
94,3,"And this was the third and probably last book I have read by this writer.  I have to disagree with another reviewer that it was an unusual story unfortunately. It was definitely well written, but I would call it extremely typical and annoyingly repetitive story for this writer.Once again the romance revolves around the extreme growth of one character and another character going down a few inches. Once again the character who is growing obsesses over the smaller character and once again smaller character is oblivious as to how charming and charismatic he is that everybody wants him.This writer certainly knows how to write and how to write well, but based on the three books from her that I have read in rather short period of time (I usually tend to seek more books from this writer if I loved one book so it is nothing unusual) I find myself quite bored."
95,4,Shelby Harper  and Navy SEAL John Garrett have had a rush on each other for over a year but neither has been reading the signs.  Shelby over hears Garrett talking to his best friend and she decides to make the first move.  This is a short steamy story with mature topics. I found this author a few months back - so far here are my favorites;Going For ItandHeat of Passion: An Out of Uniform story.. Off to find more by this author !
96,3,"I enjoyed the read.  The story concept works and the sex is definitely hot., the characters do things that are surprising and explained away as ""the way we do it."" The characters rarely speak to each other about the things that matter. They worry and wonder in their heads but don't share their thoughts when it really counts. I would love to see more backstory. There is definitely room to grow the characters."
97,5,"This author delivers and keeps on delivering. Awesome job, even more awesome books. I keep reading her books every chance I get."
98,5,"this was a very nice read! It had pretty hot scenes and some tender moments too. makes you want to believe that there are ""angels"" out there watching out for us!"
99,3,"I own several styles of tablet cases and this is one of them but it is not my favorite primarily because it is made of thinner material and does not provide as much protection as the other cases I own.  It is not bad and the price is down to a lower level where it makes it attractive to some.It is made of neoprene stretch material and it has a faux leather portion on the front and back to give you a better grip.  The neoprene would be to slippery to hang onto while carrying your tablet.  It does protect your tablet from minor bumps and scratches but like I said, I have other cases that I feel are much more padded and provide better protection.If you are low on a budget then this case is not bad and it is better than carrying an unprotected tablet.  It is well made and it features a sturdy zipper close with dual zipper pulls for ease of opening and closing.  It will keep your tablet clean and protect it from spills but provide average or below average protection from drops.It may be too big for some size tablets and your device may feel loose in the case. The case only opens on two sides and you have to remove your tablet to use it.  This means that while using your tablet it is unprotected so this is something to consider when buying this type of case.  If you want full time protection then this case is not for you.  The advantage that this case has over cases that offer full time protection is that when you are holding your tablet and using it, you do not have the added weight of a case to also have to support. That reduces hand and arm strain if you are reading over long periods of time."
100,5,"Book Name: Your Health = Your pH: How To Reverse Illness & Gain VitalityBy Amy MosherAmy Mosher. The name has it all. She is my inspiration. I never thought that my subconscious feelings about certain kind of food had reasons behind them. But now I know what I needed to know. ""Your Health = Your pH"" is the first book I ever read from Amy. The book name further extends to ""How to Reverse Illness & Gain Vitality"" which IMHO is what this book is trying to do from page one. This book is for everyone, a book that covers grounds for living healthy life.The book itself is pretty small one, about 60 pages at stretch. But the amount of information it holds is simply outstanding. It begins with the basics like what is pH and why it is so important. I don't want to sound all technical but the simple fact behind this book is ""We're all walking chemical equations"" and if we keep it balanced, we will live a good healthy and vigorous life. Book starts off with introduction to pH and how it represents state of our body and what are various diseases that could get hold of our lives if pH balance deteriorates. Then author dives into the topic of Minerals and how they are responsible for our growth and wellbeing as well as how they help in fight against intruder viruses and underlying diseases. Amy later discusses, the most common mistakes we do which result in imbalance in our pH level. Book further puts forth various ways through which we could correct our pH levels.There are things in this book that are simply astounding in nature, for example how a simple can of cold drink put's your bodies mineral reserves haywire. In author's words, ""Majority of all diseases correlate to a lowered pH, reduced oxygen and shortage of minerals"", which makes it inevitable to know what we can do about them. The best way to put this book is (Amy's own words); ""Your pH level is an indication of your general health, not a diagnostic tool for a specific ailment."" so if you are on a journey to healthy life (or want to) then this book can become the most useful resource to carry.When I bought this book, I had no Idea about the contents it was providing, but small size and promising title pulled me in. So in a sense I got more than I bargained for (in good way :) I am a computers person... so essentially I don't know much about healthcare stuff. Amy's book although little advanced but never let me felt out of place... Every line I read was making me more knowledgeable and more in control of my health. I was little skeptical when in the beginning of the book author put in various Diseases which are the by-product of our pH imbalance. So I guess the book needs some more segregated Index but other than that it's one of the best books I read on health in general.On concluding notes I would say this book deserves 5 out of 5 stars for everything. I enjoyed the whole book; definitely I'll be reading it few more times because it has lot to offer. And I'll be looking forward to reading other books by Amy in future. Thanks and enjoy your read. Highly recommended!!"
101,3,"This book was over so quickly!  I liked the characters.  I was sure the setting was in London from the character's behavior, and I was even reading it with a British accent.  I was wrong!  The mystery moves along with the main character acquiring this great dog, Carstairs and solving a mystery in the blink of the eye.  If there is a next book I hope the plot is drawn out a little more."
102,5,"Wish-granting fairies help get a couple get back together. Incidentally, they are each the other's 'the one that got away', so it was an interesting plot. And with magic involved, you know there's going to be quite a few tangles here and there, and the consequences are abysmal for the couple if the magic backfires.It was sweet and fluffy, the sex scenes were quite hot! The characters each reveal a depth to their personalities, which helps the readers understand their motives and their desires. The fairy bit added a comedic element to the book which tied it up very well. It also got me curious about the next books in the series. Highly recommended!"
103,3,"An obvious rip off of Burroughs Mars and Venus novels, it has similar good mindless action with princesses in distress and monsters to fight and evil kingdoms to overcome.  Good mindless extertainment."
104,4,"This romance book bundles the stories of heroes Sawyer, Morgan, Gabe and Jordan, 4 brothers who live together in their childhood home. Sawyer is the doctor, Morgan is the sheriff, Gabe is the laid back handyman and Jordan is the vet. Each man is in some way the pillar of their small town community, and other than being womanizers (in a nice and respectful way), they are all perfect. For that I gave a 1 star deduction. One decent, halo-over-his-head glowing, handsome, tall, muscular, sexy, honest, single, well-endowed, straight brother is amazing, two is shocking, three is a stretch, and four is defying the laws of possibility.Other than that each story was funny, sweet, and thoroughly enjoyable.Sawyer is a divorced, single father of a teenage son who runs his medical practice from his home and does housecalls. He meets Honey when she loses control of her car and crashes into his fence. Turns out she's suffering from pneumonia but is running from someone who's out to get her. Sawyer shelters her and takes care of her and in the course of that they fall in love.Morgan is single, large and a temper to match. At least he only pretends to have a temper. His bark is worse than his bite, but everyone is so afraid of him that his scowl is enough to keep miscreants out of his town and everyone else on their best behavior. Misty, Honey's sister, enters the picture when she shows up to help Honey prepare for the wedding. Morgan takes an instant dislike to her, a dislike which is only amplified by his attraction to her. He thinks she's too seductive and flirtatious and a walking billboard for trouble. What's more, Misty is broke, unemployed, and pregnant. Wrongly accused of stealing and had arrested and charged by her boss, then abandoned by her boyfriend when she announced her pregnancy. After learning of her situation, Morgan does a 180 on his opinion of her and works to clear her name.Gabe is the town's handyman extraordinaire. He meets Lizzy, a redhead he doesn't find particularly attractive at first, when she comes to interview him for a paper she's writing on people who have performed heroic acts. Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother, but she has serious self-confidence issues. This is a true story of opposites attract. Gabe is as laid back as can be, who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself. He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility. Lizzy is as uptight as one can get, freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun, and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.Jordan is the vet with the golden voice. Georgia is a single mother of two who works as a dancer/waitress to provide for her children and ailing mother. Burnt badly by her ex-husband, she doesn't trust men and doesn't know what to make of 4 men who seem to spend their lives bending over backwards to help others. Especially Jordan, who is great with her children and who has her mother eating out of his hand. Of all the books, this one is the funniest. Jordan's reaction to seeing Georgia dance in a skimpy outfit was priceless. However, of all the books, this one focuses too much on the other secondary characters. Between the romance brewing between Georgia's mother and Misty & Honey's father, and Sawyer's son, I felt a bit shortchanged on the main characters love story.What I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable. So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male, testosterone laden, treat the women like doormats heroes, it's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive. All the women had spunk which is something I also like. They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.Likable characters and cute stories. Recommend."
105,5,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful, but she is strong, compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate, but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in, but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love, hate, romance and philanthropy."

107,4,"Usually three (or more) somes aren't my style, but this was free, it was spicy, and I was curious, so I gave it a shot. I was really surprised by this one. The emotion was very well done. It ends up being an albeit very different but very sweet romance. Their love and devotion to each other was very real, their attraction palpable, and the heroine was fabulous. Her ""voice"" really leapt off the page, which made her a very real person. Was a very enjoyable read in this sense. It hooked me from the beginning and kept me reading.Only gave it four stars, though, because there really wasn't a plot and what little conflict there was was pretty flimsy. But it WAS an enjoyable read. I'd definitely look for more by this author, but I have to admit that the shortness of the book stops me. Paying three and four dollars for something this short just doesn't feel worth it to me. Not the author's fault, however. All in all, this book has a very ""fantasy"" feel to it. Enjoyable read."
108,5,"Wow!!! This is one deep book. I cried, laughed, got angry. At times it was emotionally draining, as if I was actually a participant in the relationship. I loved it! It's been a while since I've read a book that took me in so deeply. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will recommend it any time!"
109,5,"According to Twain, Heaven is years from earth, even when you are transported at .1 speed of light. It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow. 'Now, this was published 1907, and an early manuscript exists from 1868!"
110,4,"I liked this book for the suspense and the realistic portrayal of life in Iraq. The only reason I give four stars is because it got annoying with the time and location printed so often, even when dealing with the same people in the same location a few minutes apart. Location is important, but I don't care to know that a person is doing one thing at his desk at 2:22, then something else at 2:25. Just let the story flow! I still recommend it."

112,4,"This was my first Anya Bast book and I really liked it. I have looked at some of her other reads but her books seems a little too far fetched for me but to each his own. What makes this book so different from other menage stories is that the author took the time to really develop her characters. The men got to know their woman. They did not claim her and wisk her off and screw like bunnies 24/7. They took the time to woo her, they loved her, respected her, and they honored her. I also loved the fact that it was quite ways into the book before they actually had sex. This was a great read and one I would highly recommend! I would have loved more action and intrigue but for the most part I loved it. I hope this books becomes a series. Great job Ms. Bast."

My conflict with how I feel about the story is the ethics involved in a premise like the one presented in the work.  I don't mean moral ethics,as it is erotica.  I mean scientific ethics that some how are missing here.  I can't say I didn't like it. I can only say that I had a hard time buying the experiment conducted.Yes it is a story in a make-believe world.  Maybe actual studies are conducted in this manner; I just found it difficult to suspend my disbelief."

Torn between instinct and logic, and constrained by the traditions of their pride, four dominant lions must claim their mates - without drawing the attention of the human world outside their borders.""The book: Ava was the runt of the pride - always in the shadows, bullied by everyone. And she really, really needed to get laid. When new pride leader Landon finds her at a bar, he knows she's special. Can he convince her she's more to him than one orgasmic night?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifters) erotic romance.- 1718 kindle locations, 27,000 words (but finishes around 1472 locations).- m/f - explicit, frequent, sometimes aggressive (not gentle), fun.- ""Author's Note: All of my books can be read independently, but characters from previous books make appearances in later books in each series."" It is best to read the books in order.- Includes excerpts fromKiss and Kinby Kinsey W. Holley andThe Man of Her Dreamsby Robie Madison.- Note there is a free pdf available on the author's website ""A Serengeti Christmas"". It fits as Book 1.5 (a prequel to ""Serengeti Storm"").Opinion:A fun, erotic paranormal where being a shape shifting lion is an important character attribute rather than an addendum so you can fit in the genre. Lots of fun, very lusty, and a good short read. A good start to a series, but can also be comfortably stand alone. Well worth it.4.5 stars rounded down. I particularly enjoy that Ava isn't a classic Alpha female, the fact they are *lions* is important and relevant to the plot, and the sex is *fun*.-CR-"
120,5,"Sometimes I'm not sure whether a long drawn out epilogue would live up to my expectation because just being happy with a lot of sex doesn't make up a good read. But Reason Enough really did blew me away with only 45 pages. Damn. Megan Hart is still able to make me feel so much with only a novella. She cramped a few hot sex scene, Elle's inner turmoil on her decision whether to have a child or not and all sorts of emotion running through her in a few short pages.Dan is amazing as always, isn't he always is? Elle and Dan are now married and he is bringing up the question of having a baby. Elle instantly balked at the idea, she had made a terrible mum. Dan who is always being patience towards her didn't pressure her on the issue.We get to catch up on Elle's relationship with her mum and brother, Chad. We also got Marcy, who is now so very pregnant with her first child. Is great to see Elle surrounded herself with friends and family and all the love. I'm love this little novella to see Dan and Elle settled into their marriage life. But it kept me wanting more."
121,1,"The author keeps making vague references to things that happened YEARS ago in the story line but gives few details, keeps introducing new characters and yet at the same time makes it that virtually ALL the characters are all linked to one another.  Then the story ends saying ""go to my blog to continue reading"", however, this story is so drawn out now that not all the stuff was found by me on the blog, I was directed to buy more books that were more chapters in this ongoing saga.Since this was a freebie book, I'm out no money, but it was definitely a waste of time reading this."
122,4,"If you love historical romance with plenty of steamy scenes, read this book. I liked the main couple, who went through a lot to be together. There were times when the words seemed too modern but it wasn't distracting. I look forward to reading more of this series."
123,2,"The positive:  The book is very well written with tight scenes and well-developed characters.The negative:  I could not bring myself to like Briony.  Her constant daydreams about the perfect Master quickly became irritating as well as highlighting her shallow materialism.  The many insertions of e-mails from an online BDSM dating website were disturbing and really didn't add to the story of Chris and Briony.  In fact, the majority of the story wasn't about the relationship between Chris and Briony, but was about Briony's neurotic need to find the ""One"" and the destructive behavior in which she indulges.I completely agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the first-hand style of writing hampered this story.  I found it difficult to understand why Chris would want Briony when I had no clue to his thoughts."

A short, fast read, it lays out very clearly why world governments would want to hide this sort of information, and presents one of the real reasons, not one I'd thought of before, as to why they'll probably always continue to do so (I won't spoil things by telling you what that is; read it and find out)."
126,4,To say this is a different twist on Zombies. I am a huge Zombie fan and always have been. I keep my mind open on a subject that tends to have some strict rules for some people. Some of this I liked but I am still having a hard time wrapping my ind around the concept of Zombies with different levels of power and intelligence. I did enjoy the story but am not sure that I would classify it as Zombies because it does stray to far at times outside the rules. The main characters are likeable and I found myself rooting for MAx.

128,5,"Blind since birth, Lady Fortuna Morley never expects to marry.  She plans to live with her beloved cousin, Leticia, and live a life of independence.  Things change when Lord Granville appears to court her youngest cousin, Juliana, and brings his friend, Reverend Richard Hammond.  Suddenly Letty seems to be changing her views on marriage, and Lord Granville seems determined to enrage Fortuna at every turn.  Unwilling to let the man get the upper hand, she sets herself against his marriage to Juliana.  Unfortunately, events, and her emotions, soon spin out of control.Charles Lowden, Marquess of Granville, plans to marry Juliana for convenience's sake only.  He's annoyed when Lady Fortuna Morley takes an instant dislike to him, and insults her without knowing she is blind.  He decides to apologize, but even that doesn't go well.  Charles is attracted to Fortuna against his will, but still believes marrying Juliana would be best.  Can he charm Fortuna into approving the match?Blind Fortune combines several of my favorite things into one book: a tough heroine with a challenge (blindness), an emotionally damaged hero, and secondary characters with their own agendas.  I was caught up in the story from the very beginning.  I enjoyed Joanna Waugh's writing, and the storyline kept me interested throughout.  This isn't to say I didn't get frustrated with it, because I did.  Charles came off as an insufferable jerk at first.  Sometimes Fortuna's stubbornness bordered on annoying as well.  The love/hate relationship was a bit too skewed toward the hate side at first.  That said, Blind Fortune had secondary characters I could root for (Leticia and Richard), some excellent sensual scenes, and several major conflicts I really wanted to see Fortuna and Charles overcome.  Fans of love/hate relationships, flawed characters, and historical novels will be sure to enjoy Blind Fortune, just as I did.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"

132,1,"There a couple of cute works in this book, but the majority are ""BAD"" I don't mean bad like ""Attack of the killer tomatoes"" or bad like make you groan for the poor pun, I mean bad like not done, there will be a one or two pairs of lines that are the start of a good limerick, and then there are some extra words thrown in to create a rhyme that does not flow. It just stops and heads off in a different direction.In the end it leaves you thinking the author is more interested in publishing strings of words then in creating quality content.As with many free e-books, the last half of this short work is tidbits from other published works by the author. Most of the limericks are so bad that if I had a ""be sure to never buy anything from this author"" list I would take the time to add everything he ever wrote to the list."

While out looking for a breach Mac and Blake, vampires, run into a group of humans and they begin to help them look for the breach.  It's then they meet Kate.  Mac instantly starts to fall for Kate but Blake is only going after Kate to anger his sire, Mac, or at least that's how it starts out.  Much more happens than what I have already told you, so you must read this book!The storyline is so unique and such a different take on the vampire/human relationship that I was drawn into the story  instantly.

Unlike some of the other earlier books by this author,  this book was well edited. The major deficiency for this book is the limited character development. If you're looking for the depth of a Clancy book, you will not find it here. However for a quick, lightweight read it was very enjoyable."
144,5,"Pete Toleffson is in Konigsburg, Texas because his brother Cal has finally convinced his fiance Docia to have a wedding ceremony. He's Cal's best man, but he has no idea what a best man is supposed to do, exactly. He's pretty sure he's not supposed to punch his brother, but the impulse is there every time he catches sight of Calthorpe's ever-present and perpetually satisfied grin. It's not that Pete begrudges his brother's happiness, but Pete's in a strange town full of stranger people and ragged from his job as a county attorney - a job that he tends to obsess over...to the point that he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. Staying away from his email and voicemail while he's in Konigsburg takes conscious intensive effort, and he could buy stock in the antacid company that keeps his acid reflux in check. Supporting his brother through The Wedding from hell might just be his undoing.If sheer force of will and hard work can make The Wedding go as planned, Janie Dupree's life would be a lot less complicated. Unfortunately, everything about The Wedding seems destined to a calamitous end despite all her efforts and the best man is absolutely no help. Not to mention, he's rude. Cute though. But Janie's seeing someone...sort of...even if he is boring and self-involved. And then there's The Wedding, which is taking every single ounce of self control and mental fortitude to deal with.Just when Pete is starting to relax, and starting to more than notice Janie and even step up a little in his best man role, Toleffsons start to pour into Konigsburg and it becomes painfully clear that the town is definitely not big enough for all of them. Neither Pete nor Janie would put money on surviving The Wedding intact.Since stumbling acrossVenus in Blue Jeans: Konigsburg, Texas Book 1when it was offered as a free Kindle download on Amazon.com, I've become totally addicted to the town and inhabitants of Konigsburg, Texas, and thoroughly pleased with Meg Benjamin as an author. With a smooth, crisp writing style that highlights the strength of the series - the quirky characters that populate Konigsburg - and makes the narrative flow surprisingly well with whatever crazy situations those characters find themselves, Benjamin has a gem of a series on her hands. As I was withVenus in Blue Jeans, I was surprised and impressed with just how quick and fun a read Wedding Bell Blues is, and credit the author for both the fluidity of the narrative and the charm of the characters and setting.I liked Pete and Janie - perhaps not quite as much as Cal and Docia, but still they were a pleasure to read about. I don't think Pete's character was quite as well developed in the beginning of this book as Cal's had been in his, so the evolution of Pete's character from sourpuss jerk to nice guy was a bit subtle, but I enjoyed the results all the same. The Wedding is a good foil for the book, though the insular nature of wedding preparations did slightly diminish the role of the town and townspeople as the forces of nature they were in the first book. What it provided, however, was a surprisingly realistic and occasionally tragic conflict with the Toleffson and Dupree families' dynamic.There was little smooth about that dynamic. With one brother whose wife is a vapid trollop with the maternal instinct most cobras would envy, a mother who disapproves of everything and anything, and an eldest brother with far too much bad history to forgive, Pete's family was pretty much nightmarish. I didn't much care for the mother or the sister-in-law, but thought it was great storytelling. Janie's got some conflict with her mother over the guy she's seeing and she allows herself to be a bit of a doormat in a couple of places when being nice didn't serve her very well, but I actually know people just like her so there was definitely a sense of realism to her character.As much as I wish a couple of the less than pleasant people in the book got more of a comeuppance, I appreciated the story as a whole and was thrilled to see the direction it's taking. I had a bit of an issue in the previous book with the speed with which Cal and Docia got together, and for my personal preferences, the relationship between Pete and Janie developed in a far more pleasing time frame, right up until the end. There was a massive leap in development towards the end that seemed abrupt and precipitous, but overall I enjoyed the entirety of their relationship.I thinkVenus in Blue Jeanswas a bit more quirky in both character and story, and just a touch more charming because of it, but Wedding Bell Blues was a more complex tale that provided more depth with the familial issues and in my personal opinion, was more realistic with an overall better plot. I've become a huge fan of Benjamin and this series and am looking forward to continuing withBe My Baby: Konigsburg, Texas, Book 3. I've enjoyed the Toleffsons and love the town and people of Konigsburg. I can't wait to return. 4.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."

146,4,"I look for bundled series for the Kindle and was pleasantly surprised with this one. A historical fiction featuring a heroine that is coming into her own, it manages to have romance without dragging sex into it too much (so far in the series) and a plausible mystery.  It manages to keep the heroine within character for her timeline rather than making her a modern-day woman in a corset and bustle."

Stuck in the middle of the National Wildlife Refuge, Oriana is surprised to find a bunker that is not only lived in, but has freshly made dinner waiting for her.  Oriana doesn't want to intrude, but the smell of food and the chance of a soft bed overcome her misgivings.Jack, Jordan and Jonathan McMathan are brothers who own and operate their security firm from the hidden bunker in the middle of the Refuge.  They work for the US Government, but that isn't the main reason why they live like they do.  The main reason is that they can turn into Kodiak bears at will.  None of them ever expected to be discovered by a sexy blond pilot who is bringing a fairy tale to life. But in this case, can all of them have the happily ever after?What's a woman to do when she is faced with three very different, very sexy men?  In Oriana And The Three WereBears, Oriana soon finds she just can't chose only one and believes she might hurt the three brothers because of that.  The brothers McMathan had made a pact years before, never expecting to be able to fulfill it, until they find Oriana - one woman who could complete them all.  The emotions and sparks start flying when they meet, but misunderstandings also begin right away.  I had to smile when it became obvious to me that they all wanted the same thing but hadn't figured out a way to get it.  I was not surprised when Jack finally took over and set up the ground rules that proved to give everyone just what was needed.  Oriana And The Three WereBears is a fun and erotic romp with an unusual foursome.JoReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"

These little middle schoolers were cute and energetic. I especially liked Alex's younger brother Argus. There is something about finding old maps and comparing them for missing streets and such. He seemed quiet and the thinker. You meet some other interesting characters and find the mystery very intriguing."
153,3,"This story started off very strong and caught my attention.  I found it very disturbing in nature (not for the faint of heart), but hard to put down.  However, as the climax came near, I found it very obvious and predictable in nature"
154,4,"I'm not normally a fan of anything sci-fi.  It's not a genre I would normally pick up to read.  I'll be honest and tell you that the two things that even made me download and read this book were the hot cover and the fact that it was being offered for free. I truly didn't expect to actually enjoy the book.I was proven wrong.  From page one the story (and it's hot and steamy) has you drawn in and turning the page.  The problem with many erotica books are that while they may contain a lot of steamy and sensual scenes, they sometimes lack in plot and character depth.  This book had it all and you could find yourself, very early on, being invested in each of the characters and wanting to know where they would end up.If you are like me and usually turn away from anything sci-fi, make an exception with this book.  While this one was offered free when I downloaded it, I would have been willing to pay for it, and plan on following this author and this series in particular."
155,5,"This was a wonderful, compelling story. I loved every moment of Sydney Somers book. The story about immortals looking for magical daggers to save one of their own was a amazing twist. I highly recommend this to everyone."
156,3,"This was a freebie for the Kindle, so I always hate to complain or ""diss"" anything free.  However, I guess I expected quotes that were more modern?  Many of the quotes seemed old, archaic and partial in nature.  They didn't really seem to have bearing on anything in particular.  This has many great quotes from Shakespeare and famous authors, but it just wasn't what I was looking for in quotes.  One thing that COULD have made it better perhaps, would have been a guide to help you find/select a particular quote that would be apropo of something you were searching for to pertain to a particular situation.  Let's say for example that I wanted to write my own wedding vows or I need inspiration or I am lonely and need support.  A guide at the front of the book to lead you to a particular reference/quote would have been nice.  I believe it is still worthwhile to own, just not what I was looking for in a book called ""Familiar Quotations""."
157,5,"I loved this book, I just wished it was a full story. If anyone has not read the angel series, I highly recommend it. The heroine is very likeable, she is like your best friend, she makes the tough decisions and lives with them. The love story is one of the best I have ever read. To have someone there for you no matter what is a blessing. All I can say is I am tired of waiting for the next book!"
158,5,"i'm waiting on the next book in this series  of  henry wright mysteries, i found it to be a very good book. and i had no ideal who the killer was"
159,5,"I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. WHEN I WAS SEEN WITH MY KINDLE THEY KNEW IT WAS PEACE AND QUIET TIME, I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH I WENT THROUGH ALL 7 BOOKS IN NO TIME AT ALL, BEGGING FOR MORE.  iT WAS ONE OF THESE STORIES THAT WAS TOLD DO WELL THAT YOU FELT LIKE YOU KNEW EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM PERSONALLY.  IT WAS A BOOK / SERIES THAT BROUGHT UP ALL DIFFERENT TYPE OF EMOTIONS.  IT MADE YOU PRAY THAT IF ANYTHING SHOULD TAKE PLACE LIKE THAT HERE, THAT YOU COULD FIND A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIKE THEM.  IT IS REALLY NOT TO FAR FETCHED TO BELIEVE IN THE ""PEACEKEEPER"" WHEN YOU THINK OF THE SECRETS OUR GOVERNMENT MAY BE USING TO PREPARE FOR CERTAIN SITUATIONS. AND YOU SIT THERE PRAYING THAT IT WOULD END UP IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WISHING TO DO GOOD. NOT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY BUT FOR OTHERS AS WELL."
160,5,"I loved this story, in a way it reminded me of heidi, ok you can laugh but I will explain.  In Heidi, the uncle was so determined to have his only precious daughter walk again, that he did everything he could to make that become a reality and with Heidi's help, his daughter did find the strength to walk again.  In No Matter What, same thing, a father's love, compassion, determination to have his only daughter walk again.  I loved No Matter What because although this father wanted everything to go back to what he perceived to be normal again, something was missing out of his life, to love someone and have someone love him, so as much as he tried to be this person who takes care of everyone, it is he that needed someone to take care of him and show him love.  Enter feisty Dr. Jaden Monroe to rock Adam Steele's world and change it forever! Their connection was fire from the very beginning, and it only took a match to ignite it between them.  It's a short chapter book where the author completes it but as a reader, I def wanted to read more."
161,5,This book has everything you could ever want in a great book - wonderful characters and a great story that is well written. I highly recommend it. I couldn't put it down.
162,1,"Although this title only costs $1, I still expected an ending. The sample was good, but I wish the Author had made the story a lot shorter, and then perhaps there would have been room/time to actually write a proper ending.Be warned if you like the sample, be prepared for a lot more of the same thing over and over and then the story abruptly ends. I wish I had simply stopped with the sample, but I thought what do I have to lose - it's only $1. In retrospect my time was lost. I have so many other titles waiting to be read."
163,5,"Wow.....That was a great book.  It had action, werewolves, strong main characters & lots of sexual scenes. I don't read to many of these ROMANCE books but the story line was really good.  It tells of acceptance & loyalty. Woman will be able to relate to Alexandra.  She is: strong, beautiful, confident, & a fighter.  Yet she is also a little scared, uncertain of what lays ahead, & if she will be accepted by this new family she has yet to meet. There are 3 in this series so far, I will be downloading the next book today. :-)"
164,4,"Treachery, deceit and greed are the motivation for Dardanus' actions towards the queens. But he finds it to be different once he gets to where he wants to be.A short, and sweet hot read that left me wondering what would happen next with Dardanus and Nestra."
165,5,Gage and Hailey are so sweet together I almost got a toothache reading their story!  Just a really cute story.  Loved all the characters.  Really really nice read.
166,5,"Angie was expecting to spend a lonely Christmas all by herself until she shares some unexpected time with sexy boss Ryan Tyler at the Christmas party.  When he asks her to come home with him, she jumps at the chance.  It isn't until he is ready to leave the party that Ryan remembers he really is having company - his pal Wade.  They have shared many women in the past, maybe they will share Angie too.When Angie and Ryan arrive at his house, they can't keep their hands off each other.  A knock at the door interrupts them, and Wade is suddenly on the scene.  For the first time in his life, Ryan has to face unfamiliar feelings, and the fact that he doesn't want to share Angie.This is a very erotic sexy story.  The chemistry between Angie and Ryan is to die for."
167,4,"I have a version of ""Star by Star"" that does not include the novella ""Recovery,"" so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  ""Recovery"" tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in ""Balance Point.""  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship, it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out, like in the DVD's, where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it, but probably not to everyone."
168,3,"First in the Wild West Boys romance series, a spin-off from James&#8217; Rough Riders. This story is based in Denver, and the couple focus is on Nick West and Holly North.My TakeThis is about the West branch of the McKay family and fits in about where Cam has been back from Iraq for ten months, four months in Sundance; Colt has been sober two years now and moving out of the Boar&#8217;s Nest. Cam bought him and Buck out.It's cute enough, too cute really---it does make a sweet Christmas tale. And I was impressed that the shy Holly North should come out with that comment about how &#34;not all women mount up the same or crave that type of wild ride&#34;. It didn&#8217;t fit with the persona I was imagining, and it made me start to wonder just how wild &#34;Mistress Christmas&#34; could get.Both are hiding who they really are even though they&#8217;re telling the truth. And ain&#8217;t that a twist? It was fun, but it didn&#8217;t make it ring quite true---not enough of a twist. The story tried, it definitely tried but it was too cute and too pat. A little too Cinderella-ish.For such a shy woman, Holly certainly lost any shyness by the time she fell into bed with Not-So-Saint-Nick.It was cute how in tune they were about their feelings about the Christmas season.The StoryNick has a strong sense of honor and when his friend gets rolled by a stripper named Mistress Christmas. Only the real Mistress Christmas is out sick, and Holly is filling in to help out her friend.It&#8217;s a chance to get wild and Nick is more than willing to help her out.The CharactersHolly North is an accountant with a soft spot for a friend. And a secret urge to find out what it would be like to be wild. She has one sister, Crystal, and a brother, Tim, having kids. Ivy Lane is a friend and a client who runs a gentlemen&#8217;s club, Sugar Plums.Detective Nick West is a cop in Denver but most of his family still resides in Wyoming where his brother Blake and his dad raise sheep. Chet and Remy West are cousins building Colt&#8217;s house (he&#8217;s been sober two years now).Rudy Donner is the friend who got robbed.The CoverThe cover is a flirtatious Mistress Christmas in her stiletto-heeled red boots and black thong up against a mirror.The title is Holly as she steps up to be Mistress Christmas."
169,3,"There were a few things that I liked singularly in this story, especially the friend-to-lovers theme and the fact that Will, who is the quiet guy, had an unexpected dominant streak, but this fact was also what brought me out of the story a bit, because I see the book is tagged BDSM and I didn't really feel it as a theme of the book. There's also something that made me almost mad: Will's colleague is expecting him for dinner to set him up with her brother, he knows he has to go, but then he is caught up in his confrontation with Ethan and that fact is not mentioned anymore. I know one can't expect everything to be tied up, but what was the point? There was something good and intense in the story, but there was also something over-the-top and not deep enough. It's probably more 2.5*, but I liked Will a lot, so I'll bump it up a bit."
170,5,"I enjoyed this story except towards the end. Wished it was longer with more details to it, otherwise good read. The characters are strong and interesting."
171,5,Great continuation of the series. Already read the book about Dimitri and enjoyed that one as well. Keep them coming.
172,5,This one had me wishing for a Milo of my own. Read this in less than two hours. I could not put it down.
173,5,This was a hot read and worth the time and $!  Perfect storyline and full of love and hot sex!
174,1,this book was just silly and made no sense plot was not  good enough for me.  I expected more and it was a short novel
175,4,"This was just an ok story. I thought the characters were a little shallow and the pull that brought them together was way too fast and the booked moved from sexy to the end in a blink of what felt like a chapter (was more than that) but you get my point. Maybe it was that most of story had taken place in literally one place and it felt like there really was no room for growth to where the story ended. It was however very well written in terms format, so I would give another book by this Author a read."
176,5,Wow!  This was a very short hot book!  It was free for my E-reader and I'm so glad I picked it up.  First it was very well written with a lot of emoitonal depth that you don't normally fine in 1. short books and 2. erotica books.This author has launched herself onto my must read list.Warning:  This book is very graphic with BDSM.
177,5,"What's not to love about hot, sexy Navy Seals? I started this series with the latest release, Hotter Than Ever, and had to read every single one. I love the San Diego setting and the smoking hot love scenes. Kennedy creates very believable male characters, a great story and still keeps the very hot sex scenes abundant and meaningful. Hope their are more books to come in this series."
178,5,"Willow Gregory, also known as the former Miss Firecracker, has spent the past year making sure her behavior was all above board.  Her decision to cut loose and celebrate her freedom from the crown and sash has landed her in big trouble.  The simple fact that she wakes up in a stranger's bed wearing nothing but her Miss Firecracker sash with no memory of how she got there is just the beginning of what promises to be a wild week.Wyoming sheepherder Blake West has been at loose ends since his father decided to retire and sell the ranch.  He jumped at the chance to manage his friend's bar in Nebraska while trying to decide what he wants to do with his life.  Blake is a genuinely nice guy but he's also got a domineering side and for Willow, the combination is intoxicating.Willow has always been more of a tomboy than a beauty queen but when a childhood nemesis entered her name into the contest she had too much pride to back out.  In a way she'd kind of hoped she'd learn to be more `feminine' but let's face it, `ladies' don't get drunk and bust up a bar.  The only thing that kept her from a jail cell is a condition she agreed to - to work at the bar until she's earned enough to pay for the damage she caused.Willow's definitely not happy with this situation, but there's no denying she's incredibly attracted to Blake.  When she thanks him for being such a nice guy and not taking advantage of her inebriated state the night before, Blake sets her straight and defuses any notion she has that he's not interested in her sexually.  Blake's only filling in for his friend at the bar for about a week so keeping any relationship they embark on a no-strings attached basis would only make sense, but the more time they spend together the more they realize that what they share is much more than just sex.Lorelei James' WILD WEST BOYS series has a new addition that is hotter than any 4th of July show.  MISS FIRECRACKER had me chuckling at Willow's drunken antics - and I could only imagine how her clothing ended up hanging from the ceiling fan.  Willow and Blake fit together so perfectly that they're a pleasure to read about - especially when you consider their encounters are hot enough to leave you sweating.  Ms. James is a talented author who never fails to thrill readers with her sexy heroes and delightful storylines.If you haven't read MISTRESS CHRISTMAS yet, don't worry, these stories definitely don't need to be read in order.  The heroes of both stories are brothers and much of the plots take place in bars but they're different enough that they're well worth reading.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
179,4,I loved the characters and story line.  The romance and love that happens in each of the stories is great.
180,5,"Fantastic!  If you like the other books, you'll love this one!  Just the right balance of adventure and sexual tension to keep those pages flipping."
181,5,"I was surprised at the level or romance in this book, it was quite different than the Kate Daniels series but I loved it. Very different in both description of the Kinsmen world and the social structure. I hope there are more to come!"
182,4,"Darkest Fire, available so far only as an e-book, is a short story that is a prequel to the Lords of the Underworld series but it is completely standalone, no Dark possessed Lords here.  Instead it is the story of the origins of the box which originally imprisoned the demons before being intrusted to Pandora.  It is a beauty and the beast style romance between the beastly Guardian of the Gate to the Underworld and the beautiful Goddess of Opression whose strength keeps the walls of the Hell intact and the demons (lust, death, wrath, disease...) from being unleashed on the mortal world. It very much has the same type of feel as P.C. Cast's Goddess of the Rose with the romance between a creature that sees himself as so ugly that doesn't dare to hope that the beauteous object of his affection could see beyond his skin to his noble heart, it also has a similar type of bittersweet happily ever after. I thought that this was a nice little tease to the series before it hit the bookstores, and now that the books are out it's a brief 'just so' historical note to the series, since the box is what got all the Lords into an eternity of trouble.  One caution though to readers, if you find a love between beings of two physically different species uncomfortable, this may not be the story for you."
183,3,"Great story about men loving men & both loving the same woman. I almost got turned off by the start of the book, but am glad I kept reading. I don't think I could have done that if the book was strictly about a gay male romance. But besides the overly explicit love scenes it was a very good book.  Janice Mote"
184,2,"Modern books on this subject, which I approached from the point of view of a student of witchcraft, have more to say, better phrasing, more complete information ... I ended up wanting to throw this across the room. Since I got it on Kindle, I didn't. But it has no information not easily duplicated by others. Kindle books don't precisely take up space on your bookshelf, and it's a free Kindle at that. So help yourself, but don't expect to be very pleased by this tome unless you're an archaeologist."
185,4,This book reminds me a lot of Skin Deep; both are enjoyable and different enough that you won't be disappointed. I liked Lila and the decisions she chose to make for herself. I didn't find anything wrong with the arrangement and enjoyed how the story ended.
186,2,was shorter than it should have been. I liked the little I got of the characters personalities. Needed more writing.
187,5,"I enjoyed the story and thought it was interesting enough to finish in one sitting.  The female was hard, because she had to be and the male was sensitive enough to take care of her.  I liked the action and fight scenes and was able to follow it. Now I don't think they would have lost control on those razor-sharp rocks, simple because they were in lust for one another--getting some would have been the last thing on my mind."
188,1,"This book was so boring, I didn't even try to finish it. I usually always finish a book, and I stopped reading this part way through."
189,5,"I love this short novel about Blake West and Willow Gregory.  My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer!  The story is complete, but  I enjoyed getting to know these characters so much that I didn't want it to end.I loved Blake in his earlier appearances in Lorelei James' Rough Riders series.  He seemed like a genuinely nice guy and this book reinforces that.  Blake is sweet, charming and seriously HOT!!  He's at loose ends and helping out a buddy by looking after his bar while he takes some time off.  He isn't sure what he wants to do with the rest of his life.  He meets Willow, the former Miss Firecracker, when she gets &#34;cherry-bombed&#34; and does some damage to his bar.  She works in the family construction business and thinks of herself more as one of the guys than as an attractive, sexy woman.  The two click instantly and...you'll just have to read it yourself to find out what happens next!"
190,2,"This book is a sequel to Derrico's first book, Right Ascension.I gave Right Ascension 4 stars.This is a sequel,  but not quite a sequel,  it is a more of a ""let's get it over with"" type book.Too many characters doing too many things, too quickly, in too many places all at the same time.It is hard to follow and the ""resolution"" is totally unbelievable."
191,5,I love series. This is the first book of a series about werewolves. If the rest are as good as the first you and I both will not be disappointed.
192,2,"I only made it half way through this book.It opened OK, brief scene introducing the heroine and her father, a flurry of action to introduce the plot, and then . . . it just DIES. We spend an endless amount of time fruitlessly walking through the city as the characters mentally ruminate. There is the occasional stop for brief conversation, quick food, not to mention a little frottage (this is erotica), but this useless walking just goes on AND ON. It is the entire first half of the book!Also, the characters just behave stupidly. SPOILER ALERT: Hero leaves heroine alone in the room to go get a pizza, with instructions to shoot anybody that comes through the door. Instead, she takes a shower, knowing that it wasn't safe, but she just couldn't wait. Hmmm . . . On his part, after leaving her with these intstructions to kill anyone coming in, HE does so without calling out to her. She almost shoots him, of course. And this is AFTER she tried to brain him with a two-by-four earlier in the day in the exact same set of circumstances. Ummm . . .I won't be reading anything else by this author. But since it is free, judge for yourself."
193,5,"Very well done.  Through the reading, Duke and Mav were the epitome of str8te acting sports jocks who think nothing of a slap on the butt or pinching other guys nipples. As long as your eyes don't go below the waistline, then you're safe in the lockerroom. It was realistic in that sense and even the confrontation in the drug store with the homophobe would have made a str8te boy blush.  A Very good read!"
194,3,"The most interesting part of this compilation was the description before each story of where the author was at time of writing:  headspace, where submitted, frustrations, etc.  Some of the gore seems for gore-sake only.  Have to admit had already read the 8 Jack Daniels novels and new the serial killers from other stories.  I am glad I had read everything else purchased by Konrath, because if I had started with this one, I probably wouldn't have bought anything else.  But he's not writing everything for my group: 55, white female, educated, likes murder/detective/thriller, light or no sex."
195,3,"I enjoyed the story and David's parallel story lines were easy to follow.  However, it was clear that he has little &#34;real&#34; experience in shipboard life or with military structure and command personalities.  All of his characters are exagerated stereotypes and the interpersonal exchanges would have resulted in few of these protagonists ever reaching command because of the obvious psycholoogical abberations present.One sure indicator of his unfamiliarity with naval (spaceship or surfaceship) life is his lubberly use of &#34;the&#34; before ship names.  We who have spent many years and many deck watches know that a manned ship is truly a living entity, christened at its birth (launching), and possessing the nature and personality of its officers and crew.  Use of &#34;the&#34; before its given name is akin to referring to this book's author as &#34;the David Derrico.&#34;Also, as Isaac Azimov pointed out repeatedly, good science fiction must be good science.  I was appalled when the good Admiral referred to &#34;a new element&#34; as part of the alien hull.  Any &#34;new element&#34; in this universe would necessarily be very unstable with a half life measured in nano-seconds so can't be fairly used withhout first laying the appropriate background work.  Without that, this becomes only fantasy and not credible science fiction."
196,5,I loved it and was hooked in the first few pages. I could not put it down and was read in one sitting! Great story wtih loveable characters. I look forward to reading more from Tara Hill.
197,5,This was a good book I can't wait to read more from this author I only wish it was a little bit longer
198,3,"Entertaining enough. A little hard to swallow that one weekend would be enough to bring about the emotional change, but I don't look for realism in this genre. Sex scenes ok, could have been hotter and include more erotic banter."
199,5,I really like reading Stephanie Bond! There isn't a book of hers that I've read that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. This bookkeeper you guessing! Enjoy.
200,5,"I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself, I find they are an easy read; that is, beautifully written, engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous, not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact, many are free!!"
201,5,"At age of twenty-six, Lady Cicely Ware is considered to be quite on the shelf.  She's quite determined however, not to let spinsterhood keep her from knowing what it feels like to experience passion and she quickly comes up with a list of rakes that she believes will be able to teach her.  She's always been halfway in love with Douglas, the Duke of Ethingham, so during a waltz she propositions him.  Douglas is stunned when Cicely asks him to seduce her and quickly refuses.  Although Cicely is disappointed she resolves to move on to the next gentleman on her list.  However, very much against his will, Douglas discovers that he can't allow Cicely to be in anyone's arms but his.  As they begin a sensuous journey, Douglas is stunned to find that every moment in Cicely's company makes him only want her more.  As they finally begin to realize that they are falling deeply in love, Cicely's life is threatened and Douglas will do whatever is necessary to protect her.  As the attacks continue can he find the person responsible before it's too late?Without a doubt Melissa Schroeder gets better with each and every book!  I love historical romance and admit to being a bit of a historical romance snob, so it takes a lot for me to truly become absorbed in a book in this genre.  Melissa Schroeder's Accidental series has certainly hooked me and Lessons in Seduction is a scrumptious feast that all readers of romance will want to devour!MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
202,5,"Very creative, and little different. The story is mystery and fantasy. It ordinary and extraordinary. It feel a little like fairy tale.  I like the characters and enjoyed the book."
203,4,"&#34;Everyone has baggage. The key is to find someone who loves you enough to help you unpack.&#34; ~ UnknownMost people have better intuition that they give themselves credit for. Charlie, in 'Bastards and Pretty Boys' by KZ Snow, has what should be a near perfect life, but even so, there's this niggling in the back of his mind that the pieces that seem so well put together, don't quite fit together as well as they could. A lot of this discontent comes from his boyfriend, Kenneth, whose sincerity is questionable. When Kenneth whacks apart their relationship with a proverbial hatchet, Charlie begins to see just how wrong he's been about him and almost everything else in his life. He has a decision to make; does he continue along on this uncomfortable, but predictable path, or does he put it behind him and venture out on his own in search of a more fulfilling future?For the first time in his life, Charlie is being true to himself. He's living openly and honestly as an out and proud gay man. He's a good-natured, kind, trusting man, who even though divorced, is good friends with his ex-wife. That in itself speaks for his integrity. Since he's new to the gay scene, he's in a vulnerable position making him easy to take advantage of. Charlie thinks that everyone treats him like he treats them, but in the case of his latest boyfriend, this is far from true. Kenneth is a bastard, pure and simple. He's conniving, insecure, possessive, manipulative, and shallow. He has more baggage than an airport claim check area and poor Charlie ends up bearing more weight of it than anyone should. When the truth about their relationship is revealed, Charlie is broken-hearted, but, instead of mourning over a lost relationship that never was, he tries to move forward. Although wary of being burned again, his attractive neighbor, Booker, seems a viable option to help him heal his wounded pride.Booker is kind of a paradox. He's a bit mysterious, but surprisingly open and honest. He's in a vulnerable position in his life as well which no good way to unload his problems. When he comes on to Charlie, he does so in such a sweet way that Charlie is intrigued. It's almost idyllic the way they blend together, not just in bed, but in all things. They are both very nurturing men, but because of their past problems, the road is not smooth; yet, they are too drawn to each other to let it go. When the past catches up with Booker, he and Charlie work together to solve the problem which is more inter-related than they realized. Booker and Charlie are there for each other and are amazed at the intensity of their brief relationship.This is a good love story about how things can go very wrong in the flash of an eye. Booker and Charlie are amazing, love-worthy characters who made me feel very protective right away. When I saw how seamlessly they blended together, how perfect they were for each other, I really wanted it to work for them. The bad guys were especially bad, devious, and disgusting and I wanted them punished in the worst way. The story has some unexpected twists which made the supercharged roller coaster of a story even more emotive leading to a very satisfying ending. I recommend this story to everyone who enjoys a romantic love story with mystery, intrigue, love, passion, and good triumphing over evil. Thanks, KZ, for giving Charlie and Booker their happy ending. Originally reviewed on Rainbow Book Reviews."
204,5,I can't get enough do tatt's! The story isn't what you expect either. It was a really engaging read. I've also read slither and hope there will be more to this series...
205,4,"I got this as a freebie for the kindle and I must say for free, it was enjoyable.  The story is a short one, it is about Lacey, who is a personal trainer and appears to have problems keeping men longer than a few months.  Story starts off with her finding her boyfriend cheating on her with her friend Christy.  She didn't feel sadness for Evan, the guy she's been seeing for the past 6 months.  She was more sad about the fact that she was single again, lonely and wasn't sure why she couldn't keep a guy interested.Nick has been Lacey's best friend for the past 5 years so when he heard that she was finally single again, he didn't waste a minute.  He wanted to be with her, to console her, but also to take the opportunity to make her see him as more than a friend.  He has loved Lacey for so long that he would do anything to show her how good they could be together.

206,5,"I once owned the Ace versions of these 3 tales and I enjoyed them when I first read them, gosh, about 50 years ago!  I was happy to be able to re-read them now and, for a little while, recapture my childhood. We all know they are not great literature, but we also know they will provide us with a few hours of pure escapist entertainment. Kline was never as good as Edgar Rice Burroughs, but when you ran out of ERB, Kline was there to help fill the void. This is a very fairly-priced set inasmuch as others are selling the books separately for as much or more. My 5-star rating may be a little inflated--Kline is certainly no Charles Dickens--but I think some earlier reviews were meanspiritedly low. Believe me, you will receive more than a buck's worth of entertainment."
207,5,"I really loved this book, once I started reading it, I could not put it down.  It was a really great story."
208,2,"The book laid so little groundwork for the m&eacute;nage story that it felt very rushed. Other than that the plot was fine, with a bit of mystery blended in. It just stretched credibility too much for my taste that things developed so quickly."
209,2,"The premise was good, and hey it was free. But...the author needs to finish the book. Too many things aren't explained or finished. Minimal descriptions (visual or emotional) which you usually expect in a romance. Lots of talk about why she's never turned into a wolf, and what has to happen for her to turn into a wolf. Maybe I blinked and missed it, but despite the event occuring so she can turn into a wolf, the scene isn't there in the book!  She never becomes a wolf.  (maybe you have to buy book 2 for that?) There are several scenes that just defy all common sense.  This story is Ok for a freebie but don't pay money for it.  I'd like to know if her writting improves in her later books or if it is similar to this."
210,3,These 3 stories were really to short.  I would just get into the groove and here comes the end.  Not enough substance.

212,5,"I enjoy the Wall Street Journal, but being a daily publication, I wanted more up-to-date news breaks.  The NY Times Blog solves the issue.It pumps news stories to the Kindle every 3-4 hours, and the stories appear to be comprehensive, well-written, each about 1000 words long, and there are approximately 8-12 headlines active at a time.  So, it is not the NY Times newspaper itself regarding content amount, but getting thousands of words of up to date info effortlessly every few hours, 24/7, is well worth the $1.99 monthly. The stories are more timely than even the NY Times subscription newspaper.I have used the experimental web feature of the Kindle to secure news stories, and while that works also, it is more cumbersome, slower, takes more clicks of the wheel, and it not a neat and tidy as having active headlines 24/7 ""pushed"" to the device.I did the trial subscription to Reuters headlines and found it far inferior to the NY Times Headlines for content, photos, navigability, and writing quality.  Try both the Times and the Reuters and the difference will stun you.The NY Times blog even has photos for almost every article that are good quality, and is easy to navigate and read.  Highly recommended."

223,4,"Please don't let the reviewers who enjoy picking apart books sway you.  Often times what one person hates another loves.  Quite possibly you'll find you like this book.I didn't read the description of the book, nor the reviews before downloading it.  Sometimes I like going into a story blind because life is like that.  You never know where the road will lead.For my part, I only found a few things that threw me for loop.  The first one was when Alex, who'd been raised by her father her whole life, discovers her dad is a werewolf.  This is after we discover she believed there was no such thing as paranormal beings in the world.  One would think Alex would have struggled a tad more with the shocking news that werewolf's were real and guess what honey.  You're a half-breed.  Isn't that great?I would have gasped, stuttered and probably fainted, but within seconds of discovering this fact, Alex more or less shrugs her shoulders and goes on as though her belief hadn't just taken a turn into the bizarre.The second thing I struggled with was the fact that since Alex was `in heat'--as she was now maturing as a female werewolf--every time she looked at Joshua Striker, the hero, moisture was pooling you know where.  They had to watch out for werewolf's finding them because they, the mutts, could `smell her'.  I have to be honest and say, as often as Alex was having moisture pooling, I'd of smelt her too and I'm not a werewolf.  At least, I don't think I am.)Now that the negative is out of the way, and that's only my opinion, once I got past the above I found this book to be an enjoyable read.  It is an action packed adventure that had me turning the pages as quickly as I could.  N. J. Walters doesn't waste time going on and on with four or more pages of description.  The story moves along quickly.The bottom line, in my opinion:  If you like werewolf romance, don't mind some erotica and want a quick read, this book is for you.  The things I didn't like about the book aren't going to stop me from reading more from N. J. Walters, and will definitely be reading the second story in the series, ""Isaiah's Haven""!"

Now Ryan wants to take the next step.  If Josh will have him, Ryan wants to make his lover his husband.With This Ring is the sweet continuation of Ryan and Josh's story.  Getting married on New Year's Eve would be romantic anyway, but with these two it's a guaranteed aww!  I really like Ryan and Josh, and reading more about how their relationship progresses to marriage is enjoyable.  There's a particularly cool secondary character, one of Ryan's older relatives, who I liked a lot.  Garrett and CJ from TA Chase's Love of Sports series make a cameo appearance, and Kasey and Gram are mentioned, which is fun if you've read those books as well.  With This Ring doesn't feature a lot of conflict, but it's a nice holiday read with enough sweetness to brighten a gloomy day.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"

232,5,"I picked up two books at a yard sale when I was a kid, and I've read them over and over again, because they were so intriguing and fun to read.  (I'm an engineer, so it'd be cool to have the resources that Tom has at my disposal...)I've looked around some for Tom Swift books, and haven't been able to find them, at least, not for any kind of reasonable price, and the libraries usually don't have them either, so when I saw this collection for a couple dollars, I jumped at the chance, and my boys are now reading and enjoying the stories as well."

In fact I only decided to start reading it again because nothing else seemed interesting. Call it ""reader's block"".

238,4,"I'm not sure why some of the reviewers were so hard on this book- I wasn't expecting a great work of fiction- and it's eroticia- so my expectations weren't great.  However- this book is well written and the characters are well developed.  Unlike most eroticia- where the characters are faced with a serial killer, a stalking ex, or a bank robber (none of which ever seem all that real to me), the big issue this couples faces is realistic and typical.  Does that make for an exciting escape for the readers?  Probably not- but it felt real to me.  This was the first f/m/f book I've ever read.  I was leary of it, but it was done tastefully. I would gladly read this author again."

The writing is elegant despite the at times difficult subject matter, the characters believable and the sex scenes frequent and explosive. I enjoyed seeing how Jared and Ninia came together and how the title, Roped, was part of that fun. The growing love between the couple was tender without being sappy and Ninia's support of Jared the right balance of nurture without pandering or fussing. There was a slightly non-starter of a storyline with Jared's sister and I wonder if there is more about her in the subsequent books, I hope so!Roped is steamy and sultry, ticks all the boxes of an erotic romance and has some extra elements in it that makes it a real page-turning read. I would definitely recommend it to a friend who enjoys spicy reading material.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews"
243,1,I have never even bothered to give a bad review until this one.  I generally prefer to just let it go.  I am really glad this was a short story and I didn't waste more of my time reading it.  I had to finish it because I just could convince myself the author was really going to end the story the way he did... but I was wrong.  Dr. Watson a vampire.  Give me a break.
244,5,I would recommend reading this book by Rita Hestand. She did a good job keeping your interest. Looking forward to reading more of your works.
245,5,"Horde Wars, Scared Eden is more of a novella that centers on a shopping trip to the surface with Cady and Sid.  They are visiously attacked by a new type of Deamon that neither could sense and rescued by a sinister man that looks much like Tryton and his son who is both a healer and traveler. Not much advancement in the story line but a fun read just the same.  I like Cady and Sid, so it was fun to have them as the focus of the story."
246,2,"This novella begins with the information that we're looking at 2069 London.  Nissa, a 29-year-old barmaid, is walking down the street kicking rubble out of her way and making sure that her ""stunstick,"" a personal defense weapon, is close at hand.  Sound intriguing?  Well, let it go, because after that short glimpse of a future world, the rest of the story could literally be set anytime, anywhere.  Nissa hooks up with two vampires at a vampire recreation club.  They're a good fit for each other as they're all beautiful, completely uninterested in the world around them, and obsessed with sex.I mean, I expect sex in a vampire erotic novel.  I WELCOME it.  But what is the point of creating this whole future world and not doing anything with it?  The main characters are completely ahistorical - they could exist in 1869 or 2012 or 2069.  They don't seem marked by the obviously turbulent events of the future.  Poverty is wide-spread, but apparently vampires don't have to worry about it.  At one point, the heroine was lying in bed and realized she didn't remember the last time she'd had clothes on.  That's how boring it is.  Nothing happens but sex and they're all on the exact same page about the type of sex they want to have, so there isn't even any conflict or discovery delivered by the scenes.  This book made me realize that there can be such a thing as too much sex.  Erotica is so much hotter when characters have some speck of a life outside of having sex twenty-four hours a day."

252,4,"Private Property started off with a bang and didn't slow down until the last third of the novella! This story was full of lust, passion and sexual tension, it took up good two thirds of the book! There was a plot of course but you pretty much got to the point 80 percent in. There was so much sizzling hot tension going on I couldn't help but blush - and I read my fair share of erotic romance but this, whoa boy! talk about a Hot read!The story begins with Mark cooking up a birthday present for his girlfriend with whom he has a sort of loose relationship, he thinks nothing of sharing her with his college roommate/best friend, but when he sees Sam touching Jodi something possessive gets hold of him and before you can say gotcha, he's jealous. This story is mainly about Mark coming to realize he loves Jodi and wants to spend the rest of his life with her - but boy all the s*x and the for*play in this novel... it's seriously hot enough to melt your e-reader!I like the set up for Sam's story, Personal Protection, which I imagine will be even kinkier with his erm... sexual preference and high tech toys.If you are looking for a believable romance this isn't for you but if you like to indulge a little on a fantasy then pick this up, its one hot ride!But like all erotic romance a Happily Ever After is a requirement, and this one had it, which made all the frustration and jealousy worth reading through - who am I kidding I read this in two hours flat! ;)"
253,4,"Plot/Storyline: 4 1/2 StarsAfter a short prologue, the book opened with a scene from a family's life near Christmas.  After a little introduction, the father jumps into a tale about Saint Nick, who was the origin of the legend of Santa Claus.Saint Nick's story was an interesting mix of fantasy and history. His life seemed to mirror much of that of Jesus Christ (so, Christians be forewarned if this sort of thing disturbs you). Obviously, plenty of research went into the writing of this novel, for which the author is to be applauded. I wasn't really able to get into the Santa Claus as a healer thing, but it did make for an interesting read. For those who were wondering, yes, there are explanations for elves and reindeer, too.One drawback was that I found it very difficult to imagine a man telling the more gruesome parts of the story to children. Initially, the children listening to the story were very young girls, preschool age, I think. The audience later switched to some prepubescent boys; however, I still felt some parts were too graphic even for that age group.The story did drag a little in the middle. I really enjoyed the intervals with the modern day family Christmas. There was a story of a father and a Christmas Tree that had me laughing out loud. Those little intervals were sparse, and more of them might have spiced up the storyline somewhat. At the very least, a little humor interspersed would have given the book a more upbeat feeling.This was not a novel that would ever become part of my Christmas Traditions. It was just way too depressing, even though, oddly, at the same time it offered a wonderful explanation for the traditions of Christmas that involve Santa Claus.Characters: 4 1/2 StarsAlthough the story was all about Saint Nick, he was not very well developed insofar as the reader was not privvy to enough of his thoughts. I wanted to know what he was really thinking when he found he was able to heal. He just seemed to take it for granted. Now, I can understand that after awhile, but the first time had to be exciting or induce some kind of emotion. I think in the mirroring of the life of Christ, the author presented the story in much the same way, as a bystander, but it would have been far more interesting, since it was fictional, to have been given more insight.Writing Style: 4 1/2 StarsThe writing style was excellent for many portions of the story. Even though I felt the novel lagged in some areas, in others, the writing in other scenes felt very rushed, to the point where I had to read sections twice to catch everything. The descriptions were vivid and picturesque. The dialogue was pretty good, but I felt a better job could have been done with the accents or vocabulary to give more a feel for the time period."
254,2,"This is a very short short story.  It's basically a few scenes at a party and one night (though admittedly some entire books have taken over that period,  this one doesn't)  It's pure erotica - has an hea,  but no real relationship, no depth, just sexual descriptions.  I was really disappointed and I have to get used to this kindle notation - I find the lack of page numbers confusing,  so I don't really know what I'm getting into until I down load it.I've not found a m/m regency romance that really does it for me, and we have no idea why these 2 men love each other,  other than their looks.  This took about 30 mins to read and I wish I could return it,  even for $2.50 I felt ripped off."

On occasion, I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture, or something).  The online editions can be hard to read, and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have, but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork, the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers), easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition, in a great reading format.Well done!"

263,5,"What a great novella and prequel into the new Guild Hunter series.  This is my first time reading anything from Nalini Singh and I really enjoyed this story.  The world that Nalini has built is both innovative and exciting.  Hunters (humans) are employed by the Guild who are essentially angels, to hunt down vampires that go against their contract w/ the angels.  Vampires are ""almost-immortals"" and are sired and indentured by the angels.  Angels are not the angels from the fairy tales of sugar and spice, these angels are cruel and twisted and thrive on the pain of others.  In this novella we follow a hunter named Ashwini who is hired by the powerful angel Nazarach.  Her assignment is to travel down to Atlanta and hunt down a vampire who has been kidnapped by a rival.  To succeed in her mission Ashwini persuades a vampire (Janvier), who has escaped being terminated by her on more than one occasion, to accompany her.  Ashwini and Janvier have great chemistry and seem to make a great team.  There is a lot of sexually charged tension between them.  There is quite a bit of action and suspense packed into this novella.

It was fast paced and interesting, the kind of book that makes you think ""What woud I do, how would I react?"". I would have liked to have seen a little more time spent on character developement and on the fog itself. Also, proofreading would have been a plus. Even taking the negatives into consideration, I would still reccommend this book."
265,4,"The author does a good job of building a self-contained and mythical world that interacts with the non-magical world around it -- in much the same way that Harry Potter's contemporary world of magic is hidden while co-existing with the muggles' reality.I had a little bit of trouble keeping the seven Byrne daughters clear at first, flipping back to the early description. Eventually, their characters sorted themselves out.The girls are self-reliant, thrown on their own devices with a new infant sister after their mother dies in childbirth. These are not the kick-butt women of adult urban fantasy, but gentler young women who rely on wisdom and cunning rather than on tough talk and gun or sword play. At one point, some of the sisters sacrifice their long hair to help nearby villagers in the non-magical reality. In other words, the Byrne sisters set good examples as females with inner strength, intelligence, resourcefulness, and compassion.In the tradition of classic fairy tales, their aunt turns out to be a black magic evil-doer. But they also have protective adults in their lives -- a close friend of their mother who becomes a mentor in magic and a mysterious gentleman from the Far East who comes bearing gifts and wisdom.As a series, this work has a lot of potential. There are, after all, the lives of seven protagonists to explore.I enjoyed this book, a free Kindle download, even though I am a senior citizen. I doubt that I will continue to read additional installments. But this is just the sort of book that delighted me as a young adult. I can imagine anxiously awaiting each new chapter in the lives of the magical Byrne daughters as I once waited for my Young Adult book-of-the-month club selections that my mother regularly renewed for me."
266,5,A little short but a good read from start to finish.  Would liked it to have lasted longer and learn more about Jesse.
267,3,"Meredith is at her grandmother's bed & breakfast in Maine instead of on her honeymoon in the Caribbean, due to having found her fiancee in bed with not one, but two women. Understandably depressed, she has spent most of her time in the sun room, reading. After being admonished by her grandmother to get up and get out, she visits the village, ending up in a quaint store that is a combination candy store and jewelry store. While waiting in line to buy fudge, she meets an intriguing man.Deciding to throw caution to the wind for once in her life, she accepts his offer to accompany him to enjoy fudge and possibly other 'delights'.This book is 90% sex, so don't buy if you're looking for great literature. Also, keep in mind that the sex described is fiction, as anyone combining all the elements described in this afternoon of sex would not only wind up with a raging yeast infection, but a bacterial one as well, and that's if they were lucky. If not so lucky, there would also be the possibility of a trip to the emergency room. Taking all that into account, the premise of the situation is pretty interesting and I personally liked the ending, which allows the reader to reach some conclusions independently. If you're looking for free hot, steamy sex, this one will fill the bill."
268,4,Hot book that made you feel for them and had you sitting on the edge of your seat throughout it all :) Definitely recommended!
269,4,"I would have given a 5-star review, except for ""my bad"".  I am not great on geography and must admit I had some stuggle with that.  That said, I was completely engrossed.  Everything is so plausible.  The gnawing away at Ann's complacency brings her face-to-face with the world's reality.  Gut-wrenching toe-to-toe survival, whether you are the aggressor or the aggrieved, may start in a grey area--but must end in only black and white.  A really thought-provoking read.  Shamefully, religious wars or wars in the name of religion have always been and will always be.  I'll have to read it again to make sure I understand it all.  Definitely worth your time."
270,4,"The main character, Two, is a nineteen year-old prostitute, hooked on heroin. She is trapped in her life and has abanboned all hopes of life getting any better.Her pimp sends her to a new client and she mets Theroen, a powerful vampire who starts to change her.Due to the drugs in her system, Two does not become a vampire right away and remains a few months with Theroen before the final change. During that time, she discovers how intricate and dangerous the politics of vampire life are.This is not your typical vampire story. I  kept being pleasantly surprised by new concepts. The plot is well spaced and kept me interested until the end and, as other readers, i am willing to read the sequel.I gave it four stars instead of five because I kept wishing that the author explain, and better showcase, the love and connection between Theroen and Two. We get a very simple and quick explanation of why Theroen chose Two but it didn't feel real, logical or emotional to me. Also, the vampire scene, lifestyle and politics is touched upon but not developed. Hopefully  next time..."
271,2,"This is totally a beauty and the beast pre-quel to the main books in the series.  It's mildly entertaining but isn't going to keep you wanting more.What I found most surprising was that in choosing to have a ""sample"" of the bundle sent to me I got this book in it's entirety.  I think that says more about the book than I can.I'm still debating the actual purchase of the bundle."
272,2,"Really just a collection of memories written by the daughter-in-law in the woman's own words.  Not enough structure to keep me interested.  I should have sampled it, then I would have known that it just wasn't what I was looking for."
273,4,"M/M/F (2 bisexual males/1 straight female) usually doesn't work well for me for a multitude of reasons, and the love scenes usually make me roll my eyes. They tend to be purple and overdone. Not so in this book! The sex in this book curled my toes. I had to actually catch my breath after the first scene between Cassie and Kyle. Whew. And the heat never lets up! Every encounter in this book is a scorcher.The menage situation in this book is surprisingly believable. Cassie's attraction to both of her best friends and her heartbreak at discovering them together is sweet and realistic. Her reasons for leaving town make perfect sense. Even Kyle and Alan's reason for looking to each other for affection works pretty well. The story isn't perfect, but I found it much more believable than most M/M/F I've encountered.This book was on track to be an A+ read--and then the author pulled out the oldest menage clich&eacute; in the book. No spoilers here, but it's one of those ""love it or hate it"" issues and I'm in the latter camp.If I were to ever read this again, I'd stop after the last big love scene and skip the ending. All in all, a B- read. -9/22/08"
274,5,"I was a Catholic Seminarian for a number of years and knew about the Apocryphal writings...never had time to research them, so this was great to get on my iPad and Amazon Tablet...can take anywhere to read...fascinating stuff!"
275,1,"I almost didn't finish this book.This is about a hero that unselfishly put off from going to his mate in order to keep things normal for her. Plus they were related (not by blood, but by marriage).The heroine was fantasized and loved the hero since she can remember.When thing start to happen and their relationship finally progresses, the heroine turns into a selfish, whinny b***h (to me). I can't stand when our heroines turn into &#34;basic b****hs&#34;.So anyway, I really wouldn't recommend this book. It was not very entertaining and the aggravation of how I started to feel about the heroine took center stage for me and ruined the rest of the book."
276,3,"I loved the concept of this story, and while it was pretty gruesome, it definitely got my attention in the first few pages."
277,5,"This is a simple, no fuss, sexy and romantic read. Great novella to read in bed with your partner. The sex is great but what stands out more are the emotions of the characters. I appreciate the author taking a different route and showing us real people with real insecurities. Short, spicy and sweet story."
278,5,This was an amazing suspenseful romantic novel. The mystery as to her tragic past has caught up to her and was threatening the new life she has made for herself. Only Trent would not let her walk out of his life  again as she had done before in the middle of the night. He was not going to let her run from him this time and would uncover what from her past she was so afraid of. As it turns out  he has  to  protect her from her sisters killer that escaped prosecution risking his own life in the process. What a fast pace exciting book.
279,5,"There have been enough comments regarding the content so I won't even discuss that.Several people have commented that this isn't long enough. Frankly, I think the length is one of the things that makes it as scary as it is. To take these 2 serial killers and put that much information and fear into one chapter for each of them then to bring them together in another chapter that wraps things up nicely, totally works for me. I also like the way the 2 authors worked independently and still made the story cohesive.After reading King and Koontz for the past 40 years and watching horror films longer than that, I really enjoyed this story. However, if you are squeamish don't read this.The way this was written intrigued me. I have read a few anthologies that are by a group of authors connecting their stories to make a whole. This is the second I have read where they alternate writing the same story and it was extremely well done."
280,4,I really liked this book. I was able to get it free on my kindle ereader and I enjoyed the 2 main characters and the other characters as well. I really like to read about American Western cowboys romance. Hunky and so good looking. I had a to read it in one sitting. Thats how good it was. I can not wait to read more books by this author.
281,4,"4.5 starsSexy, sexy, sexy and sexy... I can't really find more words to describe this book. Keil is one HOT alpha male and when he meets his mate, Robyn, my computer screen almost caught on fire.I really loved the story in this book. Robyn is a wolf, but she doesn't know. She needs to have sex with a male of the species so her wolf genes can activate. I love her character and even though she is deaf, she is really strong and doesn't take any BS.There is some action towards the end and it was great, but the spotlight is on Keil's and Robyn's romance and that was aweome. The only fault of this book for me is that it was too short, I wanted MORE! =)))Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}"
282,5,"I really enjoyed this book and the little surprise waiting close to the end.  I'm not giving spoilers, but this book has a great twist that made me fall in love with the characters.  It was hot and steamy, and just made me smile, which is what I love in a great story.  I'll be looking for more work from Evangeline."
283,2,"2 out of 5 stars. This is an intriguing suspenseful romance. It's about a huge secret--finding out you had a child with a woman you don't know or don't remember--and trying to figure out how to deal with the consequences and rewards of learning this unsuspected news. Yet, once the &#34;cat is out of the bag&#34; the mother (Kate) finds that having her life on display in the tabloids starts bringing in some scary pranks that put her and her son's lives on the line. Will they be able to keep everyone safe while finding out the truth about what really happened?This is a captivating novel in the way that no matter how much it dragged on for me I was interested in how it would end and what would happen between Kate, Lane, & their son. Together Kate & Lane just worked, especially when everything seemed to be going against them.If I didn't feel like I had to push through this novel because of it dragging for me, then I would have given this a better rating. As I enjoyed the main characters & their friends, while the &#34;enemy&#34; always seemed to change for me. I kept trying to guess who the person doing the &#34;pranks&#34; was and--even though I wasn't completely surprised about who it was--I was shocked by the extremes she went through.Nevertheless, I will admit not to enjoying how the reveal of Kate's son's paternity played out. For me ... if Lane didn't go from finding out (at the end of the novel) the real truth of things, then (in a way) acting like he was saying &#34;oh yeah, now I remember and I did really like/love her,&#34; then running away from Kate, and then the following day try to make amends (in a big way) with no real explanation ... I would have also liked it better. =0/Therefore, I would only recommend this to those who are big fans of Ms. Munro.Review By: From Me to You ...

284,5,I enjoyed the series because it wasn't violent or sexy but made me think--I actually came to the same conclusions as DrThorndyke about the guilty & innocent in all but one case.
285,3,I liked that the H stuck to his gun and was serious about getting back with his wife.  Worth it.
286,3,"I really, really wanted to like this one.  Unfortunately it was only mediocre for me.  If she called her son ""love"" one more time I was going to strangle her myself.  I have a hard time believing a 13 year old would even tolerate it.  I assume the author is from the UK, which is all fine and dandy, but I'm not and I haven't the faintest idea who the counsil are supposed to be.  The government?  All the talk of elves seemed pointless as was the ""surprise"" about her son.  And why bring Joseph into it?  Bodu was a big disappointment as well.  The ending was predictable, tho well deserved.  Not good, not really bad.  Just there..."
287,4,"Great, quick read and was exactly what the description promised...loved the imagination behind ""extreme gay chicken.""  As said, it was a short read so there wasn't a ton of character development, but that didn't seem to take away from the book.  The conflict Mav felt about Duke added to the hotness factor.  There were some similarities to ""Hot Head"" (which I loved), but overall, read like a different story."

291,4,"I first heard of She's Got Balls a few months ago and couldn't stop laughing at the title. When I decided to do M/M month, this book was at the top of my ""buy"" list. I haven't read anything by Mia Watts before She's Got Balls, but I will certainly be reading much more by this author:Chris Tarpington is a rookie cop on his first undercover operation; problem is, he's got to act like the female half of a married couple. He decides he's going to make the other cop play the role of the wife, until he meets him - Dective Vincent Pilk is super-tall, super-buff, and super-gorgeous.Chris is gay but not out to the Force, so when they're on assignment and Pilk kisses him as part of the role they're playing...it takes his breath away. Of course, it's a bit uncomfortable when you're aroused and your ""junk"" is stuffed into a pair ofpantyhose! He doesn't want Pilk to know he has feelings for him, until one evening when they have to practice being ""natural"" in front of their targets....I don't usually read short stories, and She's Got Balls is a perfect example of why - I wanted more!!! She's Got Balls was funny and sexy and I enjoyed every minute of it. Chris was so funny and chatty and completely head-over-heels for Pilk, and Pilk was silent and broody and sexy as hell. This was one book I did not want to put down!"

294,5,"Amy Parker is going to Hawaii the week before Christmas on business. She has had to give up sex and relationships to focus on her career. Justin Garrett is her traveling companion and associate at the law firm.  If they didn't work together, she'd definitely do him. On the plane she boldly masturbates in the seat next to him while he's supposedly napping, but he hears everything and it makes him hard. Before they left for this trip, he accidentally found a racy email to her friend on her laptop, and he knows she wants him and he knows her deepest, darkest desires. He plans to do something about it in Hawaii.They meet with their client, Mitch Magruder, who Justin apprenticed with before going to his current job. Mitch and Justin share a friendly camaraderie, and Justin knows he can count on Mitch to help fulfill Amy's fantasy. Between the two of them, they work to get Amy to relax and unwind. But can Justin get her to relax enough to give him her heart?In Unwrapped, Jaci Burton paints a vivid picture of the two men coaxing Amy into letting herself go, and letting them both seduce her. Readers will enjoy a molten-hot m&eacute;nage scene and the exquisite feeling of finally being intimate with someone you've fantasized about for years. As with all of Ms. Burton's books, this is power packed with emotion and sensuality. I love her style and how she creates believable, intelligent characters. Unwrapped sucks you in from page one and keeps you riveted to the very end. Very highly recommended.5 Kisses, 2 Peppers (m/f/m m&eacute;nage, anal sex)~LindyReviewer, TwoLips Reviews, LLC[...]"

He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one, but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."

299,3,"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie and since it was short, I read it in between other books in my TBR list. It was just okay on all counts - as erotica, it was passable; the plot wasn't exciting, but I did make it through to the end (although there wasn't really a burning need to); the characterization was okay - if the author had fleshed out her characters more, and improved the dialogue, it would've made a better book. There was some heat to it, and some of it was written pretty well, so that helped move the story along a little more than it would have otherwise. Since I did finish it to the end, and didn't hate it, I rated it as a 2.5, rounded up to 3."
300,5,"Had a hard time putting this one down. Started reading it Saturday. Stayed up way too late trying to finish it. Couldn't do it. Went to church the next day. Long day at church, as I'm a pastor. Finished reading it during the Super Bowl! Let me tell ya...the Super Bowl was an exciting game (didn't get resolved until the last few seconds), but this book was even better than that! I had to finish it! My only complaint is...""Where's the sequel???!"""
301,4,"If you would like to save your money you can simply go to the authors website and subscribe to some kindle blogs as there is nothing and I mean nothing that cannot be found easily by taking the review list on this page (list of &#34;whats inside&#34;) and cut and past into google with the added words ON KINDLE. Youre now done. While the author clearly means well, this how to is a big let down. Full of links to elsewhere instead of explaining within its contents. Very very very very short book. I hate to give negative reviews but this should have been so much better. I feel kind of ripped off even for paying such a small amount of money. The author is talented enough to do a real job and live up to what we as Kindle people need and expect."
302,5,Great series so far. The second book is as wonderful as the first. The caricatures are wonderfully funny and endearing. Definitely worth the read. These books are short but you really get to know the caricatures.
303,4,"Blanchard & Beecher'sSecret Societiesis a product of it's time.  It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence."
304,4,"First of all, I am a big fan of HK-W and have loved just about everything she's written. So, when I saw this novel I didn't hesitate to order it. And, as always, I loved it. She is so good at characterizations and folding the past with a distinct take in the present."

306,4,"To a certain extent, Zombie Literature has been done to death and beyond, even to the point where it has become fashionable to insert zombies into classic works like Pride and Prejudice.  This book marks a nice departure from standard zombie fare, while retaining enough of the genre to keep that nice post-apocalyptic feel that zombies are so good at providing.  While I like the single-minded focus of your average zombie, I found that the idea of a few smart zombies thrown into the mix added to the sense of peril.  It appears that most of the typos referenced in other reviews have been corrected and I thought that the book was well-written, suspenseful and even funny at times.  In addition, character development was good and I found myself looking forward to the second installment.  While by no means perfect, this is a really decent effort and fully merits 4 stars."
307,3,"This story had an interesting twist because it's about three people who knew each other in high school and 10 years later they find each other again, which isn't a plot I've read before. I would have liked more character development. I know this was a short story, but it could have still had a bit more. The sex scenes were hot, but just not enough emotion. This read more like porn, than romance. I've read better from this author."
308,5,I didn't know anything about this book except it was recommended by a friend.... I read it on my way to Africa and wished I had more of the series to read on stay there and way back home!!
309,5,Love the paper. Great writers but cancelled my subscription due to the price. If the price comes down to like $12/mo I might buy it them. I do buy an occasional single issue for $.99 which I really like. Gave 5 stars for the papers content. I can't rate low due to the cost since I was aware of the cost when subscribing.
310,4,"In a nutshell:I'm going to purchase the next book and see where it leads.I feel like the primary character needed to have a bit more age and experience... and perhaps a little more inertia to his intellect rather than just constantly winging it and winning against a clever antagonist.Felt kinda like ""I grew up in the outback, now I'm kicking butt""Maybe something bridging or providing background... (another novel?) that would kinda put some meat on the character?I guess I'm saying the character's 'awesomeness' was explained in a rather uninspiring fashion.The setting is fairly well done.  The background characters are likable, even the bad guys.  Characters behave in a way that is quite reasonable to their personality and interests (ie, bad guys *not* making stupid mistakes by supposed overconfidence, the crutch of bad storytelling)."
311,5,"If you love dragons then you are in for a treat with this novel. Bianca D'Arc takes you to a land were dragons exist and are more than happy to be around people. These are not your dragons of old, these dragons are more than happy to lend a paw, tongue, whatever to help their friends out.Definitely not for children to read due to graphic sex scenes."
312,5,I love Sandra' s books ans this one is no exception. She chose a really good story line. I was unable to put it down. I love the strong characters who say what they want and are not phony. Sandra has a way of reeling you in and keeping your yarn.

314,4,"From the moment he met him, Gregory knew Ryland was his mate, but when they met Ryland was much to young to claim. Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn he may lose him.  To Gregory, Ryland has always been special, but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him.Ryland didn't understand all of the ramifications of being a tri-omega, all he knew was that he loved Gregory and wanted nothing more than to have Gregory claim him.  Being claimed by Gregory was everything Ryland dreamed it to be, but his dream may come to an end when he and Gregory discover that their happily ever after depends on someone they never met.Forbidden Desires was a good follow up book in the Tri-Omega Mates series.  I loved Ryland from the previous book and adored him even more in Forbidden Desires.  I wasn't crazy about some of the secondary characters but Ryland, Gregory and Viktor, the man who completed their relationship, made Forbidden Desires a very enjoyable read.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
315,4,I read the other 2 reviews only after reading the story itself. I wanted to see why it was rated so low. It's not just another erotic short designed to satisfy a kink craving. I would say it belongs more in an erotic horror category. I was really surprised by the plot twist but in a good way. This free read actually intrigued me enough to purchase the full series which I enjoyed just as much. I guess it just depends on what you are into. I think this book was rated low due to being placed in a catch-all category that doesn't fully describe the content of the book. maybe a disclaimer placed in the product description could clear up and confusion.
316,2,"Alright, I know that the proper term for a female dog or wolf is B itch. And it is alright to use once or twice to make a point. But the author's continuous use was just jarring it took away from the story. The word has a bad rap in today's pop culture. In fact, a lot sites will censor the B word, even Amazon.So, why would a contemporary author continue to use. If the goal is to shock, one or two uses is enough. After that, it becomes annoying.Not convinced? Let's go to the other extreme and think of the word GAY. It's a good word. It's not deregotary. We use it. Even gay people call themselves gay. Not so long ago, GAY used to mean HAPPY. But no contemporary author will use the word GAY as a synonymn for happy because pop culture says GAY no longer means HAPPY in today's context.Same with B itch. Perhaps with dog breeders, they still use that word. But we don't use that word in polite society; today, the word B itch is tantamount to a curse word.Now for the story - Elements Unbound follows Renee and Bruno, two werewolves who has special abilities that other werewolves do not have. Both have been eyeing each other furtively for some time. Now, with the current pack leader weak and the pack was ready for a new leader, Renee and Bruno's feelings have also come into a head."

I have piles of writing books on my bookshelf and in Kindle format, yet this book offers something a lot of others don't: some extremely practical ways to approach story-telling. Ms. Sokoloff discusses her own methods, ways to analyze the books and movies we love and to apply these observations to our own stories. I'm finding the notecards and notebook suggestions extremely helpful. In reading through this book, I am experiencing bursts of creative energy, brainstorming, and thoughts about how to apply some of these ideas to my own writing."
319,3,"I liked the book but had a real problem with how the heroine and his best friend manipulated him into admitting his love. It is fine to know what you want, but to try to make someone jealous by pretending to seek love or sex else where. I would have given it a better rating if the straight talk would have continued minus the manipulation. My response would have been,""If you want to have a relationship with me this is how I need it, and if and when you agree, you know where to find me"". The story would have still been erotic, but with a great scence of honesty and strength."
320,4,"This story was well done.  I am not usually one for paranormal stories, but decided to give this one a shot.  It was well developed for a short and I actually wanted more at the end, but there was all the points needed to make a good story! It wasn't just about the sex.  There was actual character motivation and connection."
321,4,"Andre Alice Norton was a very talented and gifted author. The collection has a range of genres from Western to SciFi. I bought it because of the scifi, but I loved the western stories as well. It is a shame I hadn't looked for her work outside of scifi before. You become invested in the characters plight as the story unfolds. Great set of stories, with the editors losing 1 star for not putting the books in order. Great value for your money."
322,3,"Book 5 of Bell's ""Halle Pumas"" series. Preceded bySteel Beauty. No further books at this time.Books 4 and 5 are available as a paperback anthologyAnimal Attraction.Plot:Now that Gabe has returned to town, Sarah needs to decide if she can trust him enough to give him her HEA.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 2272 kindle locations, 30,000 words, but finishes around 1940 locations.- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent. Light bdsm including D/s, bondage, spanking.- Sarah has made cameo appearances in previous books. Gabe has also played roles as the town Sheriff and Adrian's Second. Events that occurred in Book 3, during Sheri's troubles, are referenced and affect The Senate's choice of Gabe as a Hunter.- ""Only in my Dreams"" starts within days of the destruction of the rogue wolves in Book 3.- Includes excerpts fromCabin Feverby Alisha Rai,Dance on the Wilde Sideby Beverly Rae, andVery Much Aliveby Dana Marie Bell.Opinion:I didn't like this story as much as I have the others in the series. It is pretty much all relationship-driven as Gabe tries to work out what he did wrong, and Sarah tries to forgive him. But too much of it just didn't gel for me, from Sarah being really, really hurt, and then rapidly forgiving him, to her inability or unwillingness to use her Super Senses to just work out what the heck is going on!!! And there seemed to be a big chunk of the book missing while Gabe went off to learn to be a Hunter. Is this a teaser to yet another series? Otherwise, it felt like an artificial roadblock put in the way of their happiness.On the plus side, I loved the karaoke scene, really enjoyed visiting with past characters, and thought the trip to Disney World was a nice touch. The bdsm aspects were tastefully done and Sarah and Gabe are very sweet together.Bell has set in motion her new ""Halle Shifters"" series as she introduces more shifter types into Halle. Gabe's ""friend"" Chloe plays a large role inBear Necessitieswhen her brother and cousin come to visit. It is nice to see her World developing, from coyotes in New York to Wolves in Poconos and now Bears and Foxes in Halle. It looks like an interesting, complex paranormal world. Definitely an author to keep an eye on.Overall, this is a good paranormal series with erotic tendencies. The books are reasonably short and mostly relationship-driven, with small dramatic plots to keep the stories running.  But in the end I just wasn't enamoured of this one. I wasn't sure if I really wanted Sarah to stay with Gabe, or stay quite so readily. But it is worth a read, if only to complete the Pumas series and slide into the ""Halle Shifters"".The ""Halle Pumas"" series:Book 1The Wallflower- Max and EmmaBook 2Sweet Dreams- Simon and BeckyBook 3Cat of a Different Color- Adrian and SheriBook 4Steel Beauty- Belle and RickBook 5  Only In My Dreams - Gabe and Sarah-CR-"
323,5,Very HOt
324,4,I wish this short story was a little longer. I wanted to learn more about the pack. Maybe there will be a follow up later. Otherwise it was short and sexy read.
325,3,"Well written though I found the concept to be pretty bizarre. I couldn't really get into the story and found that I didn't really connect with any of the characters, though I finished the book due to a combination of morbid curiosity and a desire to figure out just what the h*ll was going on."
326,3,"This book ended quite unexpectedly for me. I'll admit to it being a good story with characters you were interested in and points of view you might never have considered, indeed the writing was at an even pace that made you want to turn the page. And in a style that expected you to make your own mind up about events and conclusions, it was an interesting read ...and yet it lacked any credible answers or explanations as though it were only part one of an incredible story, and that part two would follow to tie up any loose ends.  The end therefore was disappointing, but I think the premise was good."
327,5,"This is the second book in the Sensual Captivity series written by Aubrey Ross.  After I read Seducer, the first book in the series, and was introduced to Mal Ton, I had to find out the fate of this strong Alpha male.  He was such a central charactor in the first book and even though he came across as a hard core bad ass, you could sense a gentle, caring soul underneath all that hot, hot steamy muscle strength.  I couldn't wait to read Mal Ton's story and read about the woman that would have the power to contain the shifter.Luckily Aubrey Ross gave Mal Ton a strong woman as his heroine that allowed the Alpha male to show a few cracks in his armor allowing him to lean on her for just a few moments and made for a great story.It was a great follow up to Seducer!"
328,4,I started this book once before as a sample and am currently reading this one. Will be interesting to see where it goes. Im about 50% into it.
329,3,My husband sometimes likes the weekend edition when it is sports news time.  I like parts of the paper.  It seems to be a fair assessment of news stories
330,5,"This is a book that I am going to definitely read more than once.  It is a great story.  The characters are really well developed and likeable.  Ms. Finch (Kelly) is outspoken and a very caring teacher.  She really goes above and beyond to help some of her troubled students.  Detective Jared McNally ""Mac"" is assigned the undercover job of trying to break up the gangs that have taken over the high school and is pretending to be a student teacher in Kelly's classroom.  He is definitely a hot, strong alpha man (yum) but he is also a very caring person.Even though there is plenty of hot sex in this book the characters got to know each other and truly cared for each other before they even had sex the first time.  That was a welcome surprise for this type of book where too often the whole book ends up being about sex and little else.  I liked that there was also suspense, a lot of caring and well defined characters along with some nice hot sex.This is a must read.  I thought Mari Carr might be a little to much for my tastes with but I ended up loving this book (my first by her) and bought a bunch of her other ones.  When I read the synopsis of some of Mari Carr's before books I thought they might be too much erotica for me but the way she develops the relationships between the people and helps the reader to connect with the characters makes the books so more than a brief description can describe.  Don't get me wrong I love erotica I just like romance, a good story and great characters to go along with it.  I am so glad that I decided to read one of her books.  I almost missed a great author, who is now one of my favourites!!"
331,5,"Yes it was fast, yet it was all good. The vampire was very like able. And so was the lady in the book. She was not dome on any account. All I can say the book was good ^_^"
332,5,"It's extremely nice to be able to still keep up with what is happening on the world stage from my new home overseas.  After discovering Amazon.com, I finally was able to quit trying to find English written books and now my daily newspaper delivered every morning on my new Kindle.  The International New York Times, previously the International Herald gives me gives me an extremely broad, well written picture of what is happenig on in the world and particularly Asia as I receive the Asia Edition."
333,4,"I haven't read a lot of erotic books but I decided to give this one a chance.  Usually I don't like erotic books because I find the sex a bit harsh because it seems like out of context, forced in the story.  But this book was really good, not good as in good literature, but good in its genre and in its length.  It is a short book, I read it in less than 2 hours, but I found it an extremely nice reading.  Strangely for an erotic it is very sweet and I had a pleasant two hours with it.  The characters are very likable even if they don't seem ""real"" (real wasn't possible in this kind of situation, I think) and the story is told in a pleasant tone and rhythm."
334,1,"I got about two pages into this before giving up. The style is clunky, the internal monolog doesn't gel with the character we know, and the story starts at the end of a chase scene that probably would have been really interesting if the author had bothered to write it."
335,3,Man I wish these series were longer. I thought the book was really good. I was so into this book.
336,5,The sun shinning/ the cool breezes blowing/ the porch rocker moving and me enjoying this book.  What better way to spend the day.
337,4,"Everyone seems to be writing paranormal books these days and they seem to be either vampires or shifters, this was different!  The guy is a gargoyle.  I wasn't sure how I would like that, but it worked very well.  Good job thinking of a new way to bring us paranormal!"
338,4,"I have enjoyed these short fairy stories a great deal. They're just the right length to read one or two on the bus ride to work, without having to stop & forget my place. There are a lot of similarities between some of these stories and European fairy tales. I quite like this collection!"
339,4,"I love the writing in this one, the characters are good.  The clones are getting old.  And as I said in my review of Hallowed,  When is Jesus taking center stage,  He is the main reason we look to Christian authors for more,  We want Him glorified, not just His vessels.  Jesus needs more credit, and man less.."
340,4,"Ghost stories are just that stories, until there brought to life by a talented writer. This tales is as real as it gets!  Fast paced suspenseful and well written. Not my typical genre but a very nice change of pace."
341,5,"Fun, funny and captivating!  The characters grab you from he beginning of the series and you just cannot wait for the next book.  Love this series and this author!"
342,4,"Second in the Wild West Boys romance spinoff series from the Rough Riders with this story based in Broward, Nebraska. The couple focus is on Blake West and Willow Gregory.My TakeThis is strictly romance for those of you expecting the erotica from a James story. And it&#8217;s sweet, cute, and very, I dunno, metrosexual?? Is that a word I can use for a guy who is sensitive, sweet, concerned with his health without being obsessive, trying to find himself---and very considerate of the woman he&#8217;s with...oh, yeah.He also takes on the negative characteristics attributed to women: he&#8217;s pissed that he might just be a one-night-stand. Even though that&#8217;s all he had been looking for.It&#8217;s rare to find a romance in which the guy is the softer, gentler half, and this one is it. Blake is amazing in his understanding, in being such a gentleman (when a woman needs him to be), and such a lover when she needs that.I loved the twist James put on this right from the start with a naughty Willow waking up in a strange guy&#8217;s bed. Combine it with Blake&#8217;s reaction, and I&#8217;m all over readin&#8217; it. James also stretched Blake&#8217;s reasons for being in Nebraska out nicely. All those hints and reflections had me wondering what he&#8217;d done wrong.There were a few places where Blake took umbrage, and I didn&#8217;t understand why. Seemed out of character for him. The fact that Dreyfuss was the only person to talk about how attracted all the men in town are to Willow was annoying. Why weren&#8217;t there at least other indications for the readers to be aware of that an obtuse Willow could have not seen?Okay, for all my moaning and whining, I liked the honest communication between Willow and Blake. I did not appreciate Dave&#8217;s entry into the scene. That was clumsy and seemed more mean than anything.LOL, I did like Mandy&#8217;s ploy! And I liked that Willow caught on, to the learning part, and then eventually the truth. Then there was the scene between Blake and Willow&#8217;s dad...ROFLMAO funny.Yeah, who knew? Who knew that a McKay cousin could be so comfortable and attuned to a woman&#8217;s needs out of bed, LOL.&#34;I call you sunshine because you light up my world.&#34;The StoryToo caught up in proving herself, Willow Gregory finally realizes there&#8217;s more to life than work...thanks to so-called friends standing her up.It&#8217;s that humiliation that sets this story crackin&#8217; as Willow lashes out, and the sheriff lashes back. It&#8217;s a week of payback with the ultimate in payoff when Willow meets Blake West, an all-around nice guy who seems to have picked up some ideas from those rowdy, rough McKay cousins.The CharactersWillow Gregory is so not a girl&#8217;s girl and heads up a construction team for Gregory Construction and constantly feels the need to prove herself. Jackson is her younger brother who&#8217;s away at college. Big Kenny is her dad...and they ain&#8217;t kiddin&#8217;...he&#8217;s BIG. Cerise was her best friend, but she&#8217;s married to a soldier and living in Germany.Blake West is at loose ends, trying to find himself, and when his friend, Dave LeRoy, asks for help with his bar, LeRoy&#8217;s Tavern, Blake jumps. Darren West is his dad, and he&#8217;s in rehab for a stroke.Mandy is a hardworking waitress at the bar with a four-year-old daughter, Anya, and a fifteen-year-old sister, Roxy, to take care of; Ginny is not. A hardworking waitress that is.Norbert Fossum is a dirty old man who finally got his comeuppance. Sheriff Mayhew has an unusual approach to mayhem. Destiny is the not-friend who put Willow&#8217;s name up for the pageant. Paul Shulman is a Gregory electrician and the company&#8217;s biggest gossip. Don Dreyfuss owns the International Harvester dealership in town, and knows Willow&#8217;s daddy. Gloria is Dave&#8217;s significant other, if the break-up isn&#8217;t permanent.Catching up...This takes place about a year after Nick and Holly marry and they're expecting a child (see Mistress Christmas , 1).Chronologically, it fits in the Rough Riders series about two weeks after Indy has baby Hudson.The CoverThe cover is cute with its subtle patriotic colors in Willow's sexy, white short shorts along with the blue drill and the red bra top. I do love the tool belt that almost obliterates those shorts! All up against a backdrop of red and white fireworks bursting from a deep blue background.The title is an inciting incident in this story, for it&#8217;s the end of Miss Firecracker&#8217;s reign, and she&#8217;s lettin&#8217; loose!"
343,4,"""Damaged Goods"" is the second book that I've read and reviewed by this talented author. The first one is not part of this series, therefore, this is my first exposure to the main character, Hannibal Jones. He is what appears to be a really ""neat"" guy. He is a private investigator who knows how to get to the bottom of any problem that comes his way. Jones is extremely capable and efficient as he sniffs out a crime in order to bring about some kind of justice in his own unique way. In this fictional novel, Jones remains unintimidated by some heavy duty, mob connected individuals...and refuses to cower in the presence of some very descriptive crime scenes. He also appears to be a man with a conscience which further endears him to me. His main squeeze is successful lawyer, Cindy Santiago, whose presence spices up the plot with their little romance.Author Austin Camacho manages to adeptly spin a suspenseful yarn as he entices his reading audience to be drawn right into the storyline. He certainly had my attention right from the get go. I not only enjoyed the main character, Hannibal Jones, but also his supporting cast of individuals who add to the thrill of this mystery.  Yes...this is definitely a great mystery thriller, as it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It offers many twists and turns and a very unpredictable ending. Good stuff!Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte"
344,5,"This book is great.  I loved the three bothers.  Especially Brodey.  This book has it all laughs, love and sexy werewolves w/ a cool Scottish accent."
345,2,"The first collection of its type this book holds four stories. At the Back of the North Wind, the first is a story of goodness. Ben Hur is a great classic. It is second in the series.What Would Jesus Do highlights personal choices and how they effect life.The last story is the story it good versus evil.aptly named the The Man Who Was Thursday.  Very intriguing hard to read. Dottiek"
346,3,"This was a free kindle book that I got a couple of months ago. When I read the product description it didn't seemed like something I would like.  But I love to read different authors and genres, and I ended up surprised.  Don't normally like things that are in this setting - planets and space.  However, the setting doesn't impact the story at all - the only real mention is when they are traveling.The heroine, Aidan, is a pilot trying to help her degenerate brother, an addicted gambler. The hero, Warwick, is an enforcer with only vengeance keeping him going.The author set the two characters up well and the romance between them was well written.  This short story is a great jumping off point - I am looking forward to other installments in this series.  I am glad I took a chance and downloaded this book while it was free - otherwise I would have pass up a good read."
347,5,"I've never been one to read any kind of romance novels, but since I got my kindle I've been perusing through different types of genres.  I have read several of her novellas, she is good for keeping you entertained.  Fast paced and spicy, they are not for someone who blushes easily.  I really like this one, I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters.  Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen, cuz some like it hot.  Haha."
348,4,"Loved the book. Wish it would have been longer, but it was great. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Will enjoy reading anything this Author writes."
349,1,"The book started interesting, with the main character going to see a pyschic to find out about a hunky guy she'd been dreaming of. I definitely wanted to know more. I just knew it would be a good story. From there immediately downhill. Her best friend Charlie was annoying, she was ditzy and Cannon, who should be a hunky alpha, was everything but. I couldn't finish the story. I stopped when the werewolve got wrangled into attending a hunter's meeting. It was just preposterous. The premise of the story could have been great, but I just could not get invested in the characters or the plot. It was a big disappointment for me."
350,4,when I open my kindle app to read some I really don't want to put it down. It is quite macabre to think this is for children. There is no Disney light in these fairy tales
351,5,"This is a fun and engaging story, and frankly I have enjoyed this book much more than I expected. Good action sequences and continuous plot twists. A great story for scifi fans."
352,3,"I am really enjoying the story and the characters (am still reading), but there are quite a few very distracting errors.  In one scene, JD Ryan is suddenly ""Riley,"" and ""Turner"" randomly becomes ""Tanner"" at other points.  The book is not riddled with errors, but that's a pretty big one, something I expect to have been caught in editing with a book this pricey.  Once or twice I could overlook, but it would happen for whole scenes, and it really threw me out of the book."
353,4,I gave it a four only because it lagged in the dialogue but other than that it was great. I thought that the heady depiction of the craziness that happens at the beginning of a relationship was amazing! I definitely would read more from this author.
354,3,"Interesting twists and turns to fairy tales we all know and love.  A bit of a downer,I prefer happier books and happily everafters."
355,2,"For some reason I have the impression that Geena has changed editors. I have read many of her books, but this one is not remotely like the ones I used to like. The way she writes is sloppy with unusual indifferent lines. The story is short and is hardly a story at all. I must agree with another reviewer who 'finds herself frustrated with the lack of an imaginative story line behind all the adult scenes and foreplay.'I must give it 'only' a two star because the 5star reviews are deceptive for someone searching for a good book. I know Geena can do a lot better than this."
356,5,"It has been a long time since I first read this in school, but I truly still love it; the nuance of the time, the language of th  time used, and all the time it took Mr. Dickens to write it. Strangely enough still see a great deal of the problems today they felt with then. I strongly advise  the reading of this book, the poor people who who always look to movies to learn a story miss so much in doing this!"
357,5,Geat book loved it from beginning to ending. Would recommend it to all the lovers at heart. Elizabeth done it again
358,5,"I loved this book, but I kinda figured out what was going on with Ethan before he hever left Will the nexy morning. Keep upi the good work!!"
359,5,"I really enjoyed reading the third book in the Jane Porter series. Jane & her business partner Lily have been hired to plan a mascared/BDSM birthday party for Dirk's step-brother Antonio Grillaveal who is turning 29 & to also celebrate his bringing the wine business to the states with his partner Santos. Lily is the lead for the event and their for must be present before each aspect takes place thru out the entire weekend. Jane is also expected to help, when she is not engaged with her two lovers/masters but so far Lily has only seen Jane once and that was before the breakfast brunch on Saturday morning. However Jane does attend the huge masked ball with both her masters, where they put her on display. Read this book because it will make you laugh, cry and cum up a storm. It's about three people who decide to play at being masters & subs and it's about the fabulous time these said people are having with each other during this most amazing weekend. I can't wait to read book four!"
360,4,Two lost souls find each other and help heal the wounds that have locked away their true selves for years.  This story is perfect in that it is realistic and shows how people can change for the better even if it does not have a fairy tail ending.  Real love can endure hard problems and survive.
361,4,Rebecca always manages to grab my attention and hold it. Some books you read faster  because you can't help it. thanks Rebecca - this was very good.
362,5,"I bought this series because I had heard about the movie out recently and needed something to read for a trip. I had never read anything by this author, but of course had seen the Tarzan movies as a kid. I was pleasantly surprised although it takes some getting used to the style of writing.  I thouroughly enjoyed reading these novels."
363,3,"This author has written two really interesting characters with a nice supporting cast. The heroine is down-on-her-luck, but she's no week little victim. Girl's got backbone. Hero is an admirable military man, handsome, reliable, kind, an alpha without the macho. Two lonely hearts.This book sucked me in right away. ADORED the first half of this book, then it just became, predictable, and hokey. Dissapointed with the non-exsistent love scene. After the author built the sexual tension. I was left with no love scene just a morning after thought of their ""sweet loving"". Entertaining enough but it almost felt like two books. The first half tender, and deep. The second half corny and boring. Sorry not a keeper for me."
364,4,I must say the author is talented.  The story line is easy to follow and has just enough color to make it interesting.  I am a fan of historical fiction and really like that I can not only look up unknown words but that via my Kindle I can even jump to wiki to research a topic or idea.  If this book continues to please me I plan on getting the others in the series.
365,5,I highly recommend this book great historical reading for all agesand when you done go visit the Historical museum in Cody Wyoming andreally get a true to life feel of this great person of history
366,1,"I've read Scott Nicholson books before and have liked them, but this was so boring and I did not find it at all entertaining and when I got to the end I went back thinking I had missed something but no, that really was it...Definitely would not recommend."
367,5,"Meru Tanner finds a whole new world and a whole lot of trouble on her birthday.  But that isn't all, she also finds out she is the center of a prophecy and people are not always who they appear to be.Damon Arkadios is cursed and Meru is testing all of his control.  He must guard her, but he also plays a role in the prophecy, a role he might not be willing to take.Will the evil Damon is protecting Meru from destroy any future they might have together or will it be Damon who destroys Meru with the beast inside of him?  Can Meru convince Damon he is the one for her before it's too late?Lifting the Veil opens up a whole new world of fantasy not only for the characters, but for me as well.  R.G. Alexander's characters are complex and wonderful, pulling me into yet another exciting world.  Meru is a joy who is open to all things supernatural.  Damon is a tortured soul that Meru is more than willing to heal.  Even the secondary characters are wonderful, but I would expect no less from Ms. Alexander.  She creates a wonderful get away that I enjoyed and I hope Ms. Alexander has more in store for this world because I would love to find out about these secondary characters that she brings to life.JambreaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
368,5,"In this beautifully written book, Ms Halloff does for stray cats what Richard Adams did for rabbits.The subject matter is very upsetting and at times gruesome. The emotional hurt one suffers reading it is great, but the damage is tempered by the beautiful writing. This book is more worth downloading than anything else I have seen on Amazon this year."
369,5,"I was thrilled to see another Dark Elves story available!  If you want a story unlike any other them this is the one for you! The characters are unique, highly intellegent and gifted, as well as erotic. Jet has a way of making the story flow so that you become enveloped in the characters, their plights, loves and desires. Unlike a lot of erotica stories, I find the Dark Elves Series to be well-balanced with story development that is unique, characters that are amazing and erotic enough without being distasteful.  Another well written story! Please keep them coming!"
370,5,"This truly was a book that stands apart from the others, be it the freebies to the top selling, higher priced books of similar genre, this author is a delightful find!  I'm not so patiently waiting for more of his work and ready to be pulled into more of his ability to really flesh out characters and maintain a fast, interesting pace without predictability!!  Five stars across the board!  I keep coming back to see if he's written more (which is a rarity) because I'm simply that hooked on his style of writing!"
371,4,"I liked the book. It wasn't great, but it was good. If you are reading all this author's books this is one to read. I enjoyed the story and never would have figured out the end until those last pages."
372,2,"I give this story four stars for the story--the story was different and good.Unfortunately, the mechanics were really, really, really bad--two stars for grammar/punctuation/word usage or lack thereof!  new/knew; preachers/preacher's; asses (n) (wild donkeys) instead of assess (v); in case is two words; forefront and forerunner are one word; Bible is capitalized; no sense of how and when to use commas, periods, and apostrophes.Ms. Pray, please go to any high school and talk to the English teacher; he/she may be glad to proof your manuscripts for an inexpensive price, if not free.You should be able to write your language as well as you speak it!!  These mistakes are high school level and it's the main reason why so many e-books are so bad!!  Not for the story itself, but for the mechanics of writing!"
373,4,"I liked the story. I liked the idea. I think the errors were a little distracting but I admit its 10 times better then I could have done. That said, I wish the ending wasn't so abrupt and without little more information on the world being reviled as the fog went away and more information on the fog itself. Good story overall. I think worth a read. I enjoyed it."
374,3,A very strange book to read.  The story was a good read but strange things can happen when someone comes across a skull and things start to happens.  Do we believe in ghosts?
375,3,A real cute short story with interesting characters. I would love to see more with the same characters to see how their relationship develops.
376,5,"All three books in this series were wonderful from start to finish. The characters were well rounded and so lovable that you forgot they were characters in a book. I found myself not being able to put them down and staying up late into the night to find out what would happen next.I loved how it went from the boy to his daughter and then both of them together. This was a fantastic series for young adults or adults that are young at heart. I highly recommend this book, all three books, to everyone!"
377,4,The characters were the usual misunderstood but the storyline played out well.  Kept my interest and wanted to continually see what would happen.
378,4,"Don't get me wrong, this was a good book.  Fans of sci-fi will enjoy this book.  In fact, I am sure that they will love it!  For me, it was a little to much &#34;Aliens 4&#34; than &#34;Aliens 1,&#34; if you get my drift.The author crafts a well-written story.  The characters are good.  The uniqueness of the novel, a new idea, not the same old sci-fi book, was fantastic.  I enjoyed reading it.  I can't really say anything bad about it.  It is a good book."
379,5,"The Remnants: Stories of the Jewish Resistance.By Othneil J. SeidenI loved this book! I wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but upon reading the forward I was prepared for a wonderful historical novel. What I got was even better! I got a novel that was so based in fact and true stories that almost every encounter, every event, could be looked up and backed by historical fact. I did.I love a book that takes me so deep in the history of an event and makes it all so real that it sends me into research mode to verify things and learn more. This book did this in spades. What should have been a day or two read, turned into almost a week because I had to keep stopping and looking things up; I have over two pages of notes on events and people and rumors that I had to chase down. And Mr. Seiden never disappointed me, every part was true, from the Trench at Babi Yar, to the constant gun fire going on there by the Nazi's once they invaded Kiev. The fact that Soviet held countries, the Jews in particular, welcomed the German's as liberators from the prejudice, suppressive Communist party, only to find themselves in worse shape than they were before. The small bands of resistance fighters, turning into larger bands, the woods of Russia and the Russian weather providing the native fighters hiding places and advantages over the better equip German army. The pain of the bands too far away to heed the calls from the Warsaw Ghetto when they had their uprising Passover of 1943, and with each call they knew that no one was going to help them, not the closer resistance groups, not the allies, no one went the aid of these people that fought for over a month with no back up.The mob mentality of the people, turning on their neighbor's wasn't a surprise to me, having learned all this from a historical view point growing up more than 40 years after the fact, but in this author's writing I can see that it wasn't a surprise to him either, or his characters he writes about, having been pushed to the background, into slums, ignored by their government and spit up on by their peers over time, they expected it. The Pogrom's that the Church organized and the Government looked the other way during which they went in and massacred as many Jews as they could for centuries. What surprised them was the way the supposedly civilized German people treated them. The dislike and distrust of the Vatican and the Catholics in general, the people of the time had came through loud and clear in this work, but what came through also was the belief that people could go against what they had been taught all their life. By accepting some Genitals into their group, and trusting the fledgling groups location and plans to the couple that saved Solomon, and the Priest that spoke against the killings, and later sent Jews to them, and eventually joined them; yes, Mr. Seiden was able see all sides of the fallible humans that got caught in Hitler's quest for power and world domination.I give this book a rating of five solid stars, and am recommending it to any of my friends that have any type of interest in this area of history. Thank you for writing this book, and for giving me something new to learn about a time I thought I had pretty much exhausted all avenues on. I loved every part of this book, every death cut me, but I know it was war and it wasn't going to be pretty going into it. There wouldn't be roses and birds singing all through the story line, but they were there when it was most unexpected. A great tale very carefully and thoroughly researched and plotted out. Thank you for sharing it."
380,4,"This is my all time favorite Jules Verne story. Classic Sci-Fi. This is also one of the stories I enjoy sharing with son, while he prefers the Tom Swift series, curiousity about the center of the earth kept him interested.If you enjoyed Journey to the Center of the Earth, you may also enjoy these stories (also free):Edgar Rice Burroughs ""At the Earth's Core"" (1914)Roy Rockwood ""Five Thousand Miles Underground""(1907)"
381,4,"Have is the bad boy trying to do the right thing.  Charity wants him to do ""the"" wrong things with her.  The story of Gabe and Charity will keep you turning pages.  The characters were great together."
382,2,"This game is not for the Kindle Fire!  Also I can't purchase it on my Canadian Credit Card, thereby, no sale!!"
383,4,The whole Jack Daniels series is fast paced with an edge. Not your average cop novel bit more gruesome. If you are a true crime reader this is something you will enjoy reading. The fashion passion she has adds a quirk which is enjoyable.
384,1,no plot no character just a free excuse for a couple of badly written smut scenes. not worth the time to read it
385,3,"It's predictable of course. Predictable plot. Predictable porn. It's not a deep book, but it's a good enough book to while away some free time. It's also well written. All in all, it was satisfactory."
386,4,Somers has a new twist on good vs evil. A page turner that will keep you on the edge of your chair.
387,2,"I ordered this for the Kindle when it was free, so I'm not going to complain.  I felt the book was pretty predictible but not a bad read.  I don't understand why he included the trolls and things, but it wasn't too distracting.If you are looking for a quick ""mystery"" to read, this might do."
388,4,"I have never been disappointed with one of these books.  True, they are not intricate, deep, profound, or even complicated.  But, they are light, engaging, suspenseful, and entertaining.  Just what I need to take my mind off the routine of the day-to-day stuff."
389,3,"I get that sometimes characters are antagonistic and irritating... but to have 3 out of the 4 main characters that way through most of the book was a bit much for me. They were well developed, deep and worked great in the story. The sex, as always, was hot. The ideas behind the story were good. I know there are more in this series and will read the others because I love Tymber's books and am hoping for some redemption in the next one."
390,3,"I need to start reminding myself that I'm just not into shorter stories. Not enough pages to fully develop the world or the characters. However, it was a nice bit of light reading, pleasurable, no glaring faults, but nothing to remember a couple of months down the road."
391,3,"Living life on the run has become second nature for Kiran Tate and Logan Saeter.  As the years go by the man they are running from, Oliver Grimm, gets closer and closer to catching and ultimately destroying them.  Determined to end the battle between them and Grimm, Kiran and Logan search out Grimm's step - granddaughter and private eye Jordan Grey to help them.  When they meet Jordan they find they have two tasks at hand; convincing her that they are Norse Gods on the run from Odin who was framing them for murder and who happens to be her step-grandfather but more importantly than that is convincing her that she belongs in their bed.Jordan doesn't know what to make of the two gorgeous men that walked into her office, but from the moment she met them they turned her world upside down.Very Much Alive is a very eclectic story, with gorgeous shapeshifting Norse Gods, hot sex and a plot that carries over centuries, but it wasn't enough to hold my interest. I found the characters to be very irritating especially Kir and Logan and Jordan's siblings. However I did like Jordan, she was the saving grace of this story.  I think the author was going for quirky, tongue and cheek with this story but it didn't come across very well. Men shape shifting into cars to drive their lovers around just didn't work for me.  Although Very Much Alive was not my cup of tea, it could be a fun story for others.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
392,1,"Ok, I know it's free and shouldn't complain... but sometimes I just can't help myself. Does that make me a bad person? No, just an honest one.  At first It was ok....not bad, but then I signed up for some REAL blogs and discovered that yes...BAD, and getting worse! It's a waste of my time to read about a cooking utensil for something I will never cook or a designer's clothes I will never be able to afford.  There are occasionally some info on books, but I can certainly find that on my own.  Seriously, kitchen utensils, what the celebrities wore at a concert and Korean cooking(which is quite frequently blogged about) are not things that I will miss after canceling my &#34;subscription&#34;.  But hey, That's just me!DawnBee &#60;3(you get what you pay for)"
393,5,"This is the best book I have read this year! The author puts a unique twist on this mystery story! It contains enough action, twist and turns. Literally, you will be anxiously turning the pages as quickly as you can because each chapter is exciting! Irecommend this book to people who enjoy the following genres mystery, suspense, thrillers and touch of romance. Well worth downloading and reading. I saved this book to my favorites...."
394,4,"This is one of my favorite classic Jules Verne novels. I read this over and over again. Much better than the movies, although with the movies you have a visual component."
395,5,"Being honest here. Thought the book was great. Yes, William and Jenny had great connection. This book does a good job in describing and having a connection between the two of them- as far as dialogue, and sharing emotion. Not just hot scenes (although, there is that!)Oh, note please- there was, in my opinion- some anal play/stimulation mentioned in this book. Again, HOT."
396,3,"It wasn't bad.The story was simple. Werewolf loves She-wolf and vice versa. They're mates. They get it on. There were only 2 complications to the formula. The first being that they're ""distant cousins"", but only because the author was too chicken to make them actual siblings. The author made them ""adopted"" siblings anyway so you had the forbidden thing going without becoming icky (even though siblings was clearly what the author wanted to happen anyway!) The second complication was the criminal investigation element. The main male character was a cop and the female main got caught up in a case he was working on. Both of these complications weren't really looked into with great detail. They were just there.***UPDATE: Sorry, my mistake... Kinsey Holly pointed out to me that the main characters aren't cousins, just related by marriage. I also apologize for jumping into conclusions when I said this is what the author intended. I just read too much into it, so forget I said anything about it needing to go into more detail. The only reason I did was because I was looking for more ""mental/emotional turmoil"" plot associated with this particular element, like how to justify the ick factor through love. Different story, different circumstances... Mea culpa. (I'm not being sarcastic, just to be clear.)****The characters themselves had very little personality to speak of, but they didn't need to in order to serve the purpose of this book. The purpose of this book is to have sexy scenes with 2 werewolves. It had that, and they were good scenes. I personally had a good time reading them, but then again I'm quite fond of sexy werewolf stories in general so there's some bias there.3 stars. It was a good werewolf sexy story for werewolf aficionados but probably won't make non-werewolf lovers into were-fans any day soon. Still, they might appreciate the sexy bits anyway since they weren't bad.***UPDATE: Kinsey Holly also pointed out that there are no female werewolves in her universe. Sorry about that.****"
397,5,"I have read several Shannon Stacey books and the Devlin Group series is by far my favorites!  This book is the 2nd of the 3 book series (in order:  72 hours, On the Edge, No Surrender).  I never read books twice, but I will definitely be revisiting this series and I saw on the authors website that a 4th one is in the works!  I can't say enough about this series and can definitely not pick a favorite!"
398,1,This book is written with zero chemistry between the two main characters.  The punch lines were cheesy and I don't even think that the author seems to like or respect women very much.
399,5,I almost didn't get this book because of the cover but since it was double 'LL  I did.  As always the author came through.  Good book and characters.  The plot was interesting
400,4,"Leotine and Cyprian's story is a great little novella.  She is sent to kill him and ends up falling for him.  Great new perspective, I just which they had their own full novel."
401,1,"I've read better. The story evolved way to quickly. The author did let you get to know the characters or develop the story. It was like BOOM I'm in love with some dude in my mirror. The villain was blah... Underdeveloped and beyond understandable psychotic. Martha was TOO understanding. It just read rushed . I'm all for lovely sex scenes but these were awful. The banter, pillow talk, ewe just all kinds of wrong. I will not continue this series."
402,5,"When I ordered this book I didn't realise it was a short story.....and yes its short.That aside I totally enjoyed this story, its compelling , well written and a nice twist on the normal fantasy romance."
403,3,I enjoyed this book. The pace keep the action moving and the plot kept me interested. I appreciated the way that it treated the mid-eastern characters with respect.
404,5,"I love On the Edge! Meeting Brett, Leo and Lisa through the out of the box series made me want to know soo much more about these characters. If you haven't read the out of the box set, On the edge is a great introduction to what you will get a whole lot more of in the rest of the series. HOT scenes between the trio, and the different combinations of duos too. I just reread the story again, and the second time around it is still as good as the first... now seriously thinking about reading the rest of them again too :P I love the personalities, and they all play off of each other in great ways. Thanks Kallysten for continuing to keep me aroused, entertained, and eagerly awaiting what ever series instalment you have coming out next. :)"
405,5,"Alvarado Gold for me was a breath of fresh air. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was drawn in immediately by Ms Caine's rich, evocative and descriptive style of writing. The prologue hooked me. This, on the very first page: 'The air was scented with roses and a burnt sugar...' had me settling down, knowing it was my kind of read. Immediately there was a plot, the hunt for treasure, buried by her forefathers. The subplot has Addie, our strong yet human heroine, finding her faith, reconnecting with her family (and whose family doesn't have a black sheep? Addie's cousin provides yet more guesswork and intrigue) and of course incorporates the all-important love interest, Gary White, whom we're not quite sure is Mr Right until almost the end. I thoroughly enjoyed Alvarado Gold!"
406,3,This book was good &#8211; it was a very quick read for me and I was able to finish it pretty quickly.  Alex and Celeste are great together and there is an instant attraction and great chemistry between them. The sex is smoking hot and awesome. The one thing I did not like was Alex and his need to please his father by stealing from Celeste - but overall the book was good.
407,5,Brenda Jackson is an amazing author and I sincerely love her writing.  The Steele brothers are amazing and I can't wait for Donavan to take the fall.  And Cameron Cody is EXACTLY who the soon to be Vanessa Steele-Cody needed to heal then steal her heart.  Simply fabulous!
408,5,This is the 3rd book I read by Teresa Carpenter. I loved this book from the beginning to the end. I loved how Jesse & Brock completed each other lives. I really loved how Brock stepped & helped Jesse. If you like good romance books with happy endings then I recommand you read this book.
409,5,This one kept my attention.  It is fun to read of a hero who is 60 years old.  Quite a change.  Very interesting.  easy to keep track of who is who except the killer.  Makes it easier to follow.  Would love to read more of Mr. Moats books.
410,3,"So, I'm a person who enjoys sex in a novel and thinks it can add to the chemistry of the characters. But, this book seemed to go right too it without any warm up or tension between the characters. The book started out funny and cute but just ended up boring for me when it focused so early and so much on the characters taking their clothes off. I gave it three stars for potential because I saw that the writer had ability with the humor at the beginning but it bored me too much to even finish the book."
411,5,A lovely set of books that keep you interested by jumping from one character to another. You have to keep reading to find out what's going to happen.
412,5,Loved it !  Although  this is a little out there with some of the ideas. It is also chillingly accurate at looking in the hearts and souls of others in a world gone mad. Good caring people still exist  but evil intensifies.An all to realistic look at what greedy controlling people do if given half a chance.
413,3,the book started out good. but it lost me in the middle. the story kind of fell apart. i had to make myself keep reading it.
414,5,"What a fun read!  Phoebe is a much put upon girl but sweet and sunny despite an overbearing sister in law and a clueless but well meaning step brother and a pig of a would be suitor.  Typos?  Who cares?  Baby Rose is variously mentioned as Eose, Kose, Hose.....the word So is printed as Bo and some other errors.  This in no way detracts from the story which kept me enthralled from beginning to end.  If you don't like this one, I feel sorry for you because you will be missing a good read.  Relax and enjoy.  PS.....this was written prior to 1923 and the stories reflect the times."
415,5,"Having been a devoted fan of Lovecraft all my life (he's my all-time favorite writer), I HAD to buy this book for the Kindle I just received today. It has almost all of his stories ... for only 1.99! That's less than 200 pennies! So far I only read From Beyond, one of my favorite stories of his. I found a few small typos, but that's okay. Editors are not perfect! Every book on the market has a least a couple of errors in them. I'm still giving this 5 stars. It's H.P. Lovecraft! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you're an H.P. fan!"
416,2,"You will find more depth to the characters in the Dr. Seuss books than you will find in the characters in this book.  Kron Darkbow the hero is supposed to be this tough warden from the prisonlands. He is constantly falling for traps and just blundering thru the story like a bull in a china shop.  From the very first scene, he has supposedly achieved his goal of killing the man that killed his parents, the thing that haunts and drives him. Only to find out this was not the guy responsible for their murder but just a lackey.  He then sets about trying to discredit the bad guy in a manner only the great Maxwell Smart would be proud of.  But thru the events, he completely drops his life's quest to run off after another bad guy that just seems to be a bigger threat.  Please, you could have at least let Kron decapitate the guy he was after before switching to the new one.I read the first two thinking well, it might get better, sorry the same mindess dribble carried on from the first."
417,4,"This short story about 2 serial killers is both shocking and horrific in a good way.  This quick read examines why no one should hitch or pick up hitchers.  Two authors contributed to this grizzly tell.  Jack Kilborn's character is Donaldson - he likes to rape, maim, kill, and then burn the evidence.  Blake Crouch's character is Lucy - she likes to drug and kill her victims.  One chapter is dedicated to introducing each serial killer.  Then the 2 authors shared chapter 3 & the worked together to battle of wills.  Overall is a quick, disturbing tell that is well-worth the read.  I have forwarded it on to several people who agreed with my recommendation."
418,5,Can't wait to read the next book in this series. If only i could find a few lovely men like these..pass me the ice
419,1,"I tried to like this book and after about halfway through, decided that I couldn't take it anymore. The main characters all seemed to be the same person with different names and it was hard to distinguish one from another. There were characters named Baider, Paider and Kaider in the novel and that only added to my confusion.The 2 main characters (Who could have been the same guy from all the lack of differentiation in their personalities/descriptions) spent all their time pondering their and their crewmate's relationships while fighting off aliens. Maybe its just me but if I am dodging aliens and running for my life, I am not wondering if one of my crew members is sleeping with the gorgeous doctor on board the ship...and thats another thing...everyone in the book seems to be extremely well built and drop dead handsome or Supermodel material...what, there are no ugly people in the future?One guy seems to start out white then suddenly he's described as African-American and then the book later speaks of his pale complexion....what's that all about? All the women in the book spend their time crying over the smallest incident or completely breaking down and cracking under pressure so that the males in the book feel repeatedly obligated to comfort them, put their arms around them and tell them it will be alright.The locals of the future apparently speak redneck and after reading several chapters of words written like they are spoken as in ""Yuens folks git long now, ain't no cause fer alarm..."" (I made that line up, but you get the picture), I just couldn't take it anymore.Anyways, thats my 2 cents worth. Based on the other reviews, some people enjoyed it and at $0.99 it wasn't like I was angry for throwing away a ton of money on it, but  I jist cain't see tossing money away fer no gosh darn good reason.....sorry, couldn't resist :)"
420,4,"langley manages some surprises and engages a part of me that secretly loves the fluffy genre of romance.  the happy endings (pun intended) may be too perfect but is that so bad?  we live in a world of rape and murder and injustices many of us cannot, and should not, comfortably digest so why not escape from that in a book?  langley, in an often overly disconnected genre you pull it off and are often my morphine.  i may be able to devour your books almost quicker than it takes to download them but you touch my heart that is two sizes too small.  thank you."
421,4,An ill fated escape by balloon ended up being a disaster depositing 5 men and a dog on a seemingly deserted island.  Where they worked to start a colony of sorts and where they experienced many hardships and triumphs.  A classic story filled with well defined characters and interesting locale.  The one downfall was it was somewhat wordy and of course some of the explanations of the scientific kind were outdated.  But those small complaints does nothing to diminish the quality of the tale itself.
422,3,"Sean Keller, a top business man, and Chole Walters,computer savvy assistant, meets at a bar in Denver on a business trip. The two ends up having a one night stand both only wanting spicy companionship for the night. At least, that what it was thought to be believed. However, fate finds it's way into the picture. Chloe leaves the next morning planning on never to see Sean again. Chloe stumbling into her work office after a night of wild sex to find that Sean is her new boss! But she has bigger issues at hand ( if that's possible). Someone at the company is stealing millions of dollars and her name is attached to the crime. Finding ways to prove her innocence and to keep clear of that fine hunk of a new boss she just inherited, Chloe must choose between years in prison of a crime she didn't commit or trusting a complete stranger to her clear her name. What you get at the end is a true shocker.If you're looking specifically for a book that is all about the sex and less romance, then this is a good choice. The book holds your interest with having a suspense flare to its plot.However I had problems. One thing that turned me off with the book was how Chloe was such a weak women. For someone trying to clear their name of fraud, she was too timid in my opinion when she needed to be more aggressive. Secondly, I didn't like the fact she let her boss use her sexual as she did because she'd been in a one-night-stand with him. At times, I was screaming for her to speak the hell up! Please! However, I find this to be a reoccurring problem with lots of IR erotica/romance books. The women are very strong sexual but not as strong outside the bedroom their so much or reserved. Would be nice to see less of that.Overall, I still thought the book was a good read and would recommend it."
423,3,Not only was this book super short but when you met the characters in the other books and even when the whole contest thing went down these were actual characters that had life to them.  This book or e-book seems to have been slapped together just to finish the series I guess.  You pay for what you get.  For 2 bucks and some change it's not worth it.  I think it really sucked and lacked the creativeness of the other books.  I know this is to be a romance and what not but the book is a waste.  Sorry to repeat myself but I am really mad because I fell in love with the Atlantis Series.  5 thumbs down
424,2,"Not good. It didn't have a good story line. It was all sex, but no base for the story to grow."
425,5,Love the Travers brothers.  This is one of 4 of the great stories about four brothers who are ranchers and all singleEach brother has baggage and bumps to overcome to get the greatest reward of love. Must read!
426,4,"This is a short story that takes flirting to another level. The raunchy sexual encounters will have one fanning themselves.  Who knew flirting with an unknown stranger  while driving could lead to something kinky.  That what happens when Esa get con by her best friend and set up by her sister to drive  past a construction site and flirt with the construction workers while waiting in traffic.  What happens when Esa and her mystery man, Fynn, accidentally met later open up a sexual encounter that has one person assuming a false identity and another trying to come to terms with heartbreak and their future."
427,4,"This was a lovely story! After 10 years of not seeing each other because of what happened, James and Lorna found each other again. I was really happy for them and their miracle. God was her God too despite what her father said..... loved that!"
428,4,"I loved this romance story. Hot sex! However, at the end, I feel the story went dead. This story could have ended sooner and not dragged out so long."
429,1,"LIGHT SPOILERS- I don't say anything that you don't get from the product description, but be warned anyway. It's hard to explain what I hated about this book without specific references to what DIDN'T happen. No plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Disappointing book 2 of the Halle Pumas paranormal romance series that starts withThe Wallflower: A Hunting Love story, Halle Puma Series Book 1.. You HAVE to read book 1 first as this one starts during the climax of that book. While I am a fan of Ms. Bell's work, I have to tell you I am REALLY disappointed with this book. Book 1 was overly simplistic, but I could forgive that because it was book 1- this book was a step backwards entirely. I'm not even sure why this story got to be its own book. It could have been just an additional chapter or two in book 1.CHARACTERS: It is possible for characters to be UN-DEVELOPED? Simon and Becky are both great characters- but they were developed more in Book 1 than in this book ABOUT THEM. In fact, many of their mannerisms from book 1 disappeared and they became just cardboard cut-outs of what any couple in any shifter romance story could be. The tension between them evaporated- they were dancing around each other before, afraid and uncertain. Simon was artistic and a ladies' man and Becky was the shy, well-grounded partner in her store, but none of those characteristics were apparent in this story. They actually LOST their personality.PLOT: There was even LESS plot here than the product description implies. This was basically a continuation of book 1. There was no additional storyline. No additional conflict. No new bad guys. No new obstacles. It looked like Becky might have a long road to recovery after the attack- she needed to heal and to come to terms with what happened and finding out about the pumas... and that was all resolved in a couple paragraphs. Becky wasn't mad. She wasn't scared. She wasn't even badly injured. She didn't resist Simon. She didn't play hard to get. Simon didn't have to woo her or apologize. Simon supposedly had been a ladies' man- but even THAT didn't become an issue. No confrontation with Belinda or other exes. No discussion around why they never dated or expressed interest in each other sooner... NOTHING!!! More happened between these two in book 1 than here. It takes exactly one minute for Becky to just accept the existence of werecats, the fact that she's Simon's mate, and the fact that she has been turned into one.Like Max with Emma, Simon changed Becky into a puma without warning and without asking permission. She didn't complain- not ONE word of protest. She wasn't concerned about what it might mean for her life. She wasn't even surprised. Seriously, that's just absurd. If for no other reason than it could have offered something more substantial for the story!!!There was a very bizarre plot element of having Becky able to tell when the phone was going to ring before it did. What on earth was that about? It was cute, but didn't come to anything.BOTTOM LINE: This book was infuriatingly dull. I would tell you not to bother reading it, except I expect you probably need to if you want to bother with the rest of the series. I'm not really sure I do at this point. Ms. Bell's The Grey Court series is MUCH better than this one- at least it has a plot.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series2. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- with frolicking dolphins3. Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe (The Gray Court)- sexy, humorous para-romance with all manner of fae: Sidhe, dragons, leprechauns, vampires and more4. Kresley Cole's slightly more adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)5. Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob (The Nightwalkers, Book 1)- demons, were, vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy6. Marie Harte'sRachel's Totem- lighter, less developed para-erotica featuring a variety of shifters in a quirky little town7. Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass series8. Moira Rogers' magically diverse romance seriesCrux: Southern Arcana, Book 19. Nalini Singh'sSlave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, Book 1)- romance series which features weres and psychics, but also carries plotlines with some substance10. Sydney Somers' gargoyle spin on romance: Primal Hunger: Pendragon Gargoyles, Book 111. Christine Warren's somewhat inconsistent, but often awesome series Wolf at the Door (The Others, Book 1) - skip the one about werecats, it had a weak female lead"
430,4,"I have read just about everything this author has written and decided to read this series, even though it seemed to be very raunchy. This book isn't quite as steamy as the first book and I found that I really enjoyed it. I like the way the author develops her characters and I like the way there is no insurmountable misunderstanding. I love the way the H's always fall head over heels for the h's despite not wanting to and despite they are alpha's. I love a good romance and this author always delivers!"
431,3,"Can a woman from an abusive background find love and a lasting relationship. Apparently so. Can she find the love she needs in a menage a trois? Apparently so. Chris is able to overcome the trauma of being raised by an alcoholic abusive father and a mother who was completely submissive to him. Throw in a brother who has grown up to be just like the father and this poor girl has a lot to overcome. She did with the help of her lovers Jon and TJ. This is a short read can be done in one evening, While not out standing was entertaining. Chris is to be given a lot of credit for her strength in overcoming her horrible background."
432,5,"President Ulysses S. Grant left behind an amazing historical document, and I am stunned at what a fine writer he was. The book is slow reading, but truly wonderful."
433,2,"This book has a rather farfetched, but interesting premise...that a group of West Pointers going back over a hundred years are secretly controlling the world.  Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.  All of my previous comments stand, and Mayer will hopefully turn out something better next time."
434,5,"This story had a lot of twists and turns, and I could hardly put it down! Several themes to keep it interesting made it a good story. I loved the characters!"
435,5,"Every once in a while, I come across a story that I believe I could happily follow the lives of the characters beyond where the book ends. This was one of those books. This was a good length (I love the longer ones) but I still wanted more. I love Sterling and Owen together. It was nice to see Owen learning about the lifestyle and himself, as much as I enjoyed seeing Owen (much more experienced) realizing his flaws and growing as well. These two are perfect for each other. I really enjoyed the level of bdsm which was on the lighter side. The build up and anticipation was wonderful and made for a fabulous read. I really wish there was a sequel for me to start on right away."
436,3,"A good biography, but a little slow reading.  Written by his Sister, therefore more from a family point of view.  Strictly LDS History."
437,5,"This love story is delightful.  Ryan and Mariah , a workaholic father and a genius child,  are living a life devoid of real happiness.  Ryan wants to secure Mariah' s future, by making a fortune and having Mariah' s intellect developed.  Being at work and not spending time with Mariah, causes her to look for a mother.  Chance brings Kelsey into the father and daughter's lives.  Bringing these three people together makes their story an enjoyable and interesting  read.  The author,  makes each character  realistic. This was quick read because I could not put the book down.  I hope everyone will enjoy this much as I did.  True romance will always win with me."
438,4,"This is an awesome book!! You are quickly thrown in the mix of "" the life"", learning how to deal with real life situations from a street mentality point of view."
439,3,"I don't normally read historicals, or alternate reality. However, I almost always read Ellora's Cave freebies due to the fact I have found SO MANY good authors from this house. And then there are the authors whose work doesn't click with me. When it doesn't click, it really doesn't click. That's where I am with this book.I can't even give a very brief synopsis, other than an aunt and her consort are trying to marry off 3 sisters. They will choose their husbands from winners of a tournament. Much is made of 2 of the sisters competing in said tournament, but then no details of the tourney are given. None. Anyway, the sisters meet their suitors and smexy times ensue. And they all lived happily ever after.The sisters are basically all the same person. The suitors, except for the foppish one, are the same. To the point where I had no idea who was romancing who. I couldn't keep the men straight. There are 5 of them, and they are hiding their identity, so I started wondering are there actually 5 or really only 3? I still don't know. Throw in a completely pointless menage...Now I like a good menage scene as much as the next girl, but this was not a good scene.Technically, the book is fine. No typos or distracting grammatical errors. The prose is flowery and lush. I just have no idea what the author was talking about.If I had been inclined to keep going back over passages and flip back several chapters in order to figure out what the mmm-mmm was going on, maybe I would have enjoyed this. Life is too short for me to do the author's work for them, though.Bottom line - Time wasted. The plot was indiscernible for me. YMMV."
440,2,"I got this as a free download,  and usually score them more generously,  but even free,  something's are not worth my time... I have to finish the book to give it 3 stars,  and I didn't,  so it gets 2.  5495 locations.Jim Richards is 60 years old, has only one friend and drinks 6 beers a night (he prefers to drink 8 but he's unemployed now) and he also lives with his parents, but they didn't seem to have much personality or input.  But it wasn't his character so much as the simple way that the story was told that lost me.  When pondering on who the killer might be Jim thinks: ""Honestly,  I wouldn't know what a killer even looked like.  All my crime books left that to my imagination.  On TV, they were the last person you would suspect, not very outstanding looking"" - and that's about the level of all the writing.  It was too banal and I wasn't engaged.  I let it go.Edited to add - I immediately received a very curt comment from the author and looking at the other reviews,  I can see a trend of bullying of any negative reviews,  which puts me off the entire matter.  I would never read anything by Bob Coates again... Bob Coates has since deleted his comment,  but the issue of his rudeness and attempts of intimidation are still true and I will keep this review up."
441,3,It is hard for a book to be timeless and this one was definitely aged - Not as clever as it thought it was in these current times.
442,3,it was a ok read but very predictable and a little on the short side.  i like long books that give me hours of escape
443,1,Not worth your time or money to read unless you feel need a Walt Disney ending. Story lacks heat and things become vanilla. Suddenly everyone is healed and wants normal relationships and lifestyles. Huge disappointment. Even their disagreements lack warmth.
444,4,"Posted First on The Romance Reviews.Donna Callea has written an intriguing story. It is thoughtful and fun, but has a twist of evil and perversion, unexpected in the fairy tale like setting. The tale comes complete with a young princess and a New Year Angel. With such fable type characters, the evil seems darker in contrast. Does happily ever after truly exist in this tale, or as sometimes happens, can evil spread its oily presence, blotting out what is good and kind?In an earlier era, countries across the world were at war and many small Eastern European Principalities simply ceased to exist, swallowed up by neighboring countries. Such was the case of the country where Princess Natasha (Tasha) was born. Losing her beloved parents at an early age, she was raised by her very cruel aunt and uncle, the Count and Countess. Her only friend was their son Gregori, a young cousin her age who often took the beatings with her. An older American finances them; his only requirement is they keep Tasha sheltered and never, ever cut her hair. He intends to marry her when she grows up.With the help of her cousin Gregori, on the eve of her wedding, they make plans to seek out a barber. Because Harold's whole fantasy revolves around her hair, they decide to cut it off. The chosen barber is young and in awe of Tasha. Initially refusing to cut her hair in the style she asks, he finally gives in to her begging. She is determined and he is intrigued.When she had Gregori drop her at her aunt and uncle's home, they are livid, horrified at what this simple haircut would mean to their way of life. She was beaten brutally and left lying where she fell, unable to move and barely able to breathe. Gregori found her and determined they would run away, but the only place he could think of was the barber that had shown her such kindness. Can he hide and protect Tasha from those that meant her harm?Tasha is a kind and thoughtful young woman, trying to live life as she was dealt with. She believes in Misha, the Angel of New Years. He brings happiness to those in times of need. In order to have enough happiness, he requires stories of ""Thorns to Feathers"", looking for the joy that comes through from distress. She is constantly looking for the kindness and joy in everything, knowing that it is the only way her life will become as it should. This is when she first realizes that she is in love with Mike, her barber. Not just with Mike, but with his family as well, including his mother and his young daughter Molly.Mike is beyond horrified by what he observed when Gregori delivers her to his home. She has very little semblance to the young woman from a few hours previous, but her goodness shows through. He is drawn to her, and yet feels guilt, feeling disloyal to his deceased wife Annie. As Tasha heals and the friction turns to heat, it is all he can do to keep to himself. He is concerned for her fate, what will happen when she is well?THE HAIRCUT is a madcap story full of evil, but with a kind and generous angel, waiting for those that can find good in everything. Only then can he perpetuate and spread that happiness throughout the world. It is a fun and whimsical story about the life of a young princess and the family that takes her in. Twisted throughout this story is a dark and dangerous thread of evil. Will Misha prevail?..This book was received as a free download from the author through The Romance Reviews. All opinions are my own based off my reading and understanding of the material."
445,5,"I was born not long after the end of World War II.  Some of my earliest memories are of hiding under the table out on my Grandma's porch listening to my Dad and all of my uncles talk about their experiences during the war.  World War II, and in particular the Holocaust, has always held a fascination (for want of a better word) for me. I've read countless books on the subject, watched dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hours of movies and documentaries, and even had a chance to see & hear about some of what happened first hand both here at home and living in Germany.In general, I do not approve of fiction when it comes to the Holocaust.  Let me tell you why.  This is an event that must never be forgotten, an event that some (all too many) deny ever happened, even with many survivors and combatants on both sides still alive. So, when I hear about something like ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", first presented as a real event, then later declared to be a complete fiction by the authors themselves, I cringe.  It will not be long before all of the direct witnesses have passed.  Even my generation, the ones who heard the stories first hand, who saw the tattoos, who have walked the remnants of the battlegrounds, are getting on up there. Before too long, there will be nothing to witness except words written in a book.  Those words must be truth, not fantasy.  Otherwise, in 25 or 30 or 40 years people can simply point to a stack of made up books and say ""see - all fiction - never happened.""There are some cases, though, where a story is important to tell even if it must be told through the medium of fiction because there are no longer living witnesses - or perhaps never were.  One of those stories is the roundup,subsequent abandonment and final shipment to Auschwitz of more than 4,000 children in the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris, an action carried out by the French police on Petain's orders.  There were few survivors - a mere handful - and most of those were young children at the time.  Tatiana de Rosney does an excellent job of telling the story of this horrific event inSarah's Key.Until very recently even the fact that there WERE Jewish partisans was not particularly well known, at least not in popular mediums.  Leon Uris talks about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising inExodus.  Rudi Weiss joins the Jewish partisans inHolocaust.  Only in the last few years has the story of the Bielski Brothers -The Bielski Brothers: The True Story of Three Men Who Defied the Nazis, Built a Village in the Forest, and Saved 1,200 JewsandDefiance- truly documented the Jewish Resistance.  As heroic as the Bielskis were, their group was not the only Jewish resistance group. It is vitally important that a couple of decades from now, when all who were there to witness or spoke to those who witnessed are gone, that people know that everyone did not march quietly to the slaughter like so many sheep, that the Bielskis were neither alone in their resistance nor an aberration. There is room in the historical record forThe Remnant - Stories of the Jewish Resistance in WWII.Othniel Seiden's story has its foundations in a great deal of research - interviews, records of the Nuremberg proceedings, diaries left behind by those who lived these events - and he has done a remarkable job of presenting characters that are accurate & compelling composites.Some have commented negatively on his portrayal of the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Hitler's Final Solution, particularly as regards the Pope in office at the time of World War II, a role that has been the subject of great debate over the years, debate that is not yet entirely settled.  The basic facts that Seiden addresses in this regard - that the Catholic Church had a pact with Hitler and that the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape Europe at the end of World War II - are grounded in known, demonstrable facts.  It is only since the papacy of Pope John Paul II, himself a Polish seminary student during World War II, that there has been some attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of Pope Pius XII regarding his actions towards the Nazis and the ""Final Solution."" Had Seiden chosen to present this rehabilitative material, information that would have been unknown to the characters at the time during which these events occurred, would be to rewrite history.  That would be a grave error.Highly recommended.  This is worth your time to read."

Alia is sweet, shy and strong. I get a feeling of softness when I read about Alia's character but also a strong feeling. The suspense, action & romance are well worth reading.Dragon shifter romance readers this is a great book to read."
447,5,"I've left more of these in hotel rooms and places I've visited than I card to admit, at least 3 or 4.  Good solid product that fits and works. Meets all my expectations even works on my new Kindle (car version) and Nikon camera.Arrived on time and well packaged.  Extremely pleased."
448,4,"Enjoyed the story! Loved the characters! The story was a little choppy, but still a great story line! Worth the money to buy it and I would recommend!"
449,5,"This series is so damn hot that I am surprised that my hands are not burnt, it just seems to keep getting hotter and hotter"
450,5,I stumble upon Michelle Willingham by browsing books and I liked the summary so I read the book and in my opinion she is an excellent author and I really liked reading this book.
451,4,"This book had a steady flow, and the anticipation was building throughout.  Yes Liz was dead wrog for what she did, but in the end I really didn't see why she did it.  Darius seemed like the ideal man.  He had his faults,  but he certainly got better with age.  The book was great to me, there were really no lows, and it makes you want to read it str8 in one sitting."
452,5,"I loved lots of things about this story. The way the main characters were instantly attracted to each other, the humorous segments of the story and the sexy innuendos without getting into graphic depictions. But most of all I loved the way both family and friends, even Sister Superior, were so loving and helpful. It really made my day."
453,5,"A completely different book about magic, five-toed cats and a wife's quest for her missing husband.  A lighthouse keeper, away on a secret mission for the governor goes missing. Armed only with her husband's unusually descriptive letters, a stowaway orange cat and her fierce love for her husband, this determined provincial wife travels to an unfamiliar city to  hunt for her love.  A different kind of an adventure, where the magic is subtle, and not believing in it could be the difference between life and death. I thoroughly enjoyed this surprising book and highly recommend it!"
454,4,"I see this as somewhat of a young adult novel.  I'll read anything as long as the story is good.It was predictable for some aspects, but that does not make it any less enjoyable.  I did not find it slow or boring."
455,5,"Family secrets, dirty little problems, gambling, divorce, illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery, scandal and forbidden love. Soap opera?Not exactly. It's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic ""The Forsyte Saga,"" a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan, and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade. Galsworthy's lush writing and intricate, insightful stories are excellent on their own, but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. And as the story begins, the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte's engagement to a young bohemian architect, Philip Bosinney -- except for June's father, who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family.  Among the guests are the stuffy, domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet, unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him, she doesn't love him. But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property, even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney. At the same time, the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval, and goes to see his estranged son.Soames' determination to ""own"" Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them, and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade. But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl, he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again. And as before, Soames' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon. And even as Soames gains a new woman, he finds that you don't get everything you want...A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene's son Jon. The two start an innocent romance, unaware of their parents' past together, but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other. An aristocratic suitor for Fleur, mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface, as Fleur and Jon discover that love isn't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past...The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties. Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die, various characters age, die and weave new lives for themselves, and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals, rather than ""property.""The first part was written in a time before the world of England's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English ""Age of Innocence."" And while Galsworthy's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession, it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy, gilded, and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush, dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family, and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could (""Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl"") and lushly written descriptives (""... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago"").As for the main characters of this drama, Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity. No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal's fiance, and who is raped by her angry husband. And then a realist's version of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" if Romeo and Juliet's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote, quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers, and he a selfish, close-minded man who wants to ""own"" people. Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious, and Jon is sensitive and sweet. But there's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family, especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness, obsession and love fill the pages of the ""Forsye Saga,"" and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels."
456,3,"I found myself wishing for a bit more story line on either character in this book because it has a great foundation to build on but Shara didn't deliver as much as I needed her to.Cory seems to be a great man who doesn't want any more drama in his life but when Stephanie and her little boy came knocking at his door he steped up to the plate and became the man they needed.Stephanie is running from her past and answers an ad Cory put in the paper for a housekeeper. Her past is rocky and I wish I knew more about that, Shara hit a few highlights on the subject but not enough for me to have any real feelings about it.When Cory and Stephanie finaly get together I was left wondering about the months in between them meeting and becoming lovers. I got almost nothing that showed me how they fell in love with eachother.The ground work is there I guess Shara just wanted us to fill in the blanks. But all in all with an imagination of your own this book is a good read."
457,4,I had seen the movie and but found the actual story even more interesting.  Jules Verne had a wonderful imagination.
458,3,I would also use an alias if I wrote this.  If you like gratuitous violence this story was made for you.  Just enough plot to keep you wondering what the point is!
459,3,"If you like serial killer novels then there will be nothing earth shattering here.  Certainly don't download it if you don't like serial killer novels because it will likely traumatize you.While the gruesomeness is clearly entertaining to the authors (and okay, to the readers too, otherwise we wouldn't read this stuff) it was not terribly frightening.  I like the books where I'm looking under the bed for a week after reading.There was certainly nothing imaginative enough here that made me want to go out and buy books by either of the authors.I have to say the concept, especially the third chapter, was neat."
460,5,"Another B. J. Daniels hard to put down book.  I love the way she weaves the lives of her characters from previous books into all her books in Whitehorse, Montana.  This is a small town, but everyone has a story and a very exciting story lines.  Love the cowboys and romances."
461,1,"I hated this book and I could not finish it:(full of beatings and horrible punishments, no happy endingI agree with the other reviewer, buyer beware!"

463,5,"Greta is a Grimm, a guardian angel that protects the human race from evil entities that come from the underworld.  Greta takes her mission seriously and there is no room for the lustful feelings.  Her job is done in darkness and one night she stumbles upon a young girl fixing to make a terrible mistake.  Now, Greta will do all she can to save this young girl from tossing her life away.Rip who is also a Grimm has been in love with Greta for over a hundred years.  After a night of mind blowing sex she left him without looking back, but he hasn't been able to forget her.  He tries to forget but it's impossible.  So the next best thing is to avoid her, but one night they are thrown together.  The longer they are in close proximity the harder it gets to deny the torches they each hold for the other.There is evil rising and it's up to Greta and Rip to stop it before it kills any more innocents.  Will they admit their feelings to each other before it's too late?  Can they survive the battle that's coming?There isn't much sweet about Candy Houses but it is definitely spicy.  Greta and Rip have pasts they would both like to forget.  Greta and Rip are Grimms, these immortal guardian angel types who go around saving the world after dark, unnoticed by the mortal world.  The first thing that pops into my mind when I think of the word Grimm isn't exactly angel, but it works here.  Candy Houses is a dark story, with some twisted takes on fairy tales, disturbing yet intriguing.  The main focus is Greta, Rip and their love affair that's been smoldering for at least a hundred years.  I mean just imagine what intensity these two will bring to the sex when they get together.  I am very interested in the Grimm world.  It's dark, I don't always like dark but I do here.  Shiloh Walker has a way of getting me emotionally involved in a story within the first few pages.  I just love that and Candy Houses was no different.  I can't wait to learn more about the mysterious Grimm world and the insidious demons that haunt them.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
464,5,"This is a beautiful short story about a cop who has fallen in love with his victim. The story is very short, humble and very passionate. I Love it."
465,4,"We should all be familiar with alternate worlds - most fiction movies or literary works that describe the present or the near future are worlds that deviate from our own in small, subtle ways - for example, the movie itself and the actors playing the parts do not exist there - or may be significant variations to what we think our world is supposed to be like - think Indiana Jones and his magical artifacts.I wish I could hint at the plot of the story and then state that I will not spoil it but a story this short doesn't have much of a plot. There's a war most of us heard of and a few minutes in the miserable life of one, anonymous actor, or warrior. The charming part, and this is what earns the story its stars is the easy, smooth, almost imperceptible transition from what appears in the beginning to be 'historical fiction' to what turns out to be something completely different.I stated in my review that this is only a teaser not because I know for a fact that it is but because I can't see any other reason why the story would be written. ""In the Trenches"" could stands its own in the pages of Analog or, better, the ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" magazine but, even there, the readers would be unhappy if they learned that this wasn't the precursor of some large, expansive series of works mapping that strange universe for our wonderment and reading pleasure.Based on the teaser, I'd buy the 'big book' if and when it comes out."
466,4,"More sex than story, but the story was not neglected.  This would be a great story if it were fleshed out and made into a full length novel.  Still a good read for a novella."
467,3,"Will has been in love with his best friend since they were 15 years old.  Now 30, he's serving in the Navy as a SEAL.  He's tired of being ""just friends.""  He shows up at Mackenzie's house in the middle of the night and gives her an ultimatum.  ""Be my lover or nothing at all.""  Mackenzie has psychic visions and has the ability to read others' minds.  This has created rifts in her relationships with other men.  She has a vision of a helicopter crashing, with Will in it, so she kicks him to the friend zone to protect her own heart.Another reviewer commented on the childishness of the character's actions.  I agree.  A lot of the reasoning and decision making is not based on mature love.  It's based on a desire for self preservation.I enjoyed the other books in the series more than this one."
468,5,"I love Z!  He is one of my favorite Brothers and this is a fantastic story about him and Bella.  I love the opportunity to see a little further into their lives and as usual, JR tells a wonderful story.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves the Black Dagger Brotherhood series."

475,5,"H. Beam Piper didn't invent the parallel universes concept, but he did more than almost anyone else to popularize it.Piper's Paratime is an infinite band of parallel Earths, each splitting off as the result of a decision somewhere in history. The resulting levels range from uninhabited Earths to Earths with high space-faring civilizations. And one of those Earths discovered how to travel between these worlds.Of course a paratime traveling civilization opens the possibility of all sorts of mischief and requires a police force. Since the Original Time Line has exhausted its resources, it needs paratime travel to obtain the resources it requires to continue to exist. It's the job of the Paratime Police to keep order among the paratimers and to keep the Paratime Secret at all costs.These stories are built around the career of Verkan Val, paratime policeman extraordinary, and his efforts to help his culture keep the Paratime Secret. It's not an easy job. In the course of these stories Val has to recover a Venusian Night Hound that has been let loose on our timeline (late-40's Pennsylvania to be exact), get his sometime-wife Dalla off a world where reincarnation is scientifically proven fact before she overturns the entire civilization, and battle a gang of trans time slavers whose roots reach into the very heart of the Original Time Line government itself.Most of these stories originally appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the late 40s and 50s. Like most Astounding offerings, they're full of high action against well-thought-out backgrounds and spiced with interesting characters. It makes for a colorful offering.Although Piper had been writing science fiction for more than 15 years, he didn't attract real notice until his last Paratime story, Lord Kalvin of Otherwhen, and the unrelated Little Fuzzy. Unfortunately, depressed by financial troubles, he committed suicide just as his career was taking off. It's good to have this collection to help remember H. Beam Piper at his best."

478,1,"I understand the point of view this story was told in, I really do. But goodness, it could have been told better. I didn't expect much with so little pages, but I guess I expected more than what was given to me.This is the story of a woman recalling her life with her enormous breasts from her days as a slutty teen to when she got them removed because of cancer. It was terrible. Not only was the descriptions awful but the story itself was just terrible. No emotional content. No real consistency. No steadiness. Nothing.I totally understand why it's free, but gosh, Amazon should be paying its customers to read this crap. I literally read the first few pages, stopped, scrolled through, and wanted to burn this book.But hey... it's free so what more can be expected?"

481,5,I loved this story!! The main character Amelia is married and wants to recapture her husbands attention. She decides to take a lover. This is a very beautiful love story. It will keep you wondering what Amelia and her husband will do. I highly recommend this story for those who enjoy a romance.
482,5,This item works well when I do not want to carry my Bible.  Very easy to use when on the move.
483,4,"Interesting story filled with sorrow, hope, love faith. Held my attention hoping this couple in faith could work through their past."
484,5,"This is the story of Taurus Ramsey and Nile Becquois. It is an awesome story, I could not put it down. AlTonya Washington Is an amazing writer. The storyline just sucks you in. I wish I had a family like the Ramsey's."
485,4,"I really like it when an author has the ability to get me to connect to the story and the world they are painting. This is the reason I have thoroughly enjoyed reading anything HKW writes. It's mystical, suspenseful, romantic, mysterious and when your done you may likely seek out more books by her."
486,5,"I gotta tell you that I first heard about this series of books a few years back and was not at all interested and then I fell face first into ""the end of the world as we know it"" when I became a fan of Glenn Beck and took off my blinders and really saw what is happening to this country and to our so called civilized world. As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read. The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed. The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow. Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other. I couldn't stop myself.  I went from one book straight into the next one.  Thank God for my Kindle."
487,4,Reading this story took me back to my youth. It reminded me of when the school library was my favorite  place in school. I was where my imagination soared to places I could only dream about.
488,5,Brenda Jackson is one of the best authors around! I love her book series and I like that you can buy the series in a bundle!!!
489,4,"Very good for a freebee...Has a bit of a squick factor in that Angeline was planning to meet her kinda sorta boyfriend's son... and then has a passionate connection with said son.  Father was a cipher,  merely making things happen in the plot,  but Angeline felt like a real enough person. Alex was nicely tormented,  and very dom in a nice way.  I liked the sex,  felt the emotional connection and enjoyed this piece of erotica.  No master slave lingo,  but a sense of control and boundaries being pushed, which is actually what I prefer."
490,5,"I started reading this book and wondered if the guy would ever get his life straight.  I felt sorry for him, I worried about him and then I was angry that he was making the same mistakes.  As I read more, I started to understand why he was repeating the cycle.  Really it was no different than someone being abused, then dating someone abusive, you do what you know.  The change that this man made, was awesome and the lives he touched.  When I got to the end of the book, I was heart broken that he did not get to do more.  Very good book."
491,5,"Christopher Buecheler's writing is crisp and the darkness he weaves with his words is very entrancing. This is not a typical romance, there is heart ache, but Buecheler makes the main character a strong figure you can really look up to.  Every time it seems like she should give up, she brushes herself off and keeps going.  Overall, a good read that I accidentally downloaded when I was going to try a sample.:)"
492,5,The Bible is always the BEST book anywhere ever!  My entire family enjoy reading the Bible.  I am thinking of getting another version.
493,4,This book didn't emerse me in the characters minds or  the villains minds but almost just a bit more and I would have given five stars.
494,1,This was a disappointment. It was free but it was horrible. Maybe it just wasn't my thing. Would not recommend.
495,3,"The circumstances in which the two people meet, are beleivable. But so much after the beginning of the book is UNbeleivable. The ""mystery"" behing her husband's death and what she does as a result. The character progression throughout the book was frustrating because it didn't seem realistic. Even given that, if the intimate scenes were good, it would be forgiveable, but they were just average. If you want a slightly far fetched love story, you may like it."
496,5,"I am not for sure on how much of a difference the short story has on the overall series (I haven't read on yet), but I would recommend that anyone buy it to help them understand the whole series better.P.S.- The series is one of the best of all the Star Wars series."
497,4,I loved this book. Wished it hadn't be so short!  I plan to keep this one & read it again!
498,5,"This book is Rated M for mature. From the first page to the last, there is no doubt that it is an erotica novel. But it is a work of art, that quite frankly, it reminded me of the the Japanese classic film, ""In the Realm of the Senses"" which though definitely X-rated is considered a work of art by film makers and film aficionados all over the world.That said, ""Tricked Truth"" is also a love story. Trick Burnett and Grace Jamison, two ill-starred lovers who after 13 years met each other again. Grace married Trick's father when she was 17, making her exactly 7 years younger than Trick. After a decade of being away from their hometown of Everly, Grace returns with her son Randy whose physical traits and personality characterists resemble the Burnetts so much that no one can deny his parentage.But, there were layers of secrets that Grace kept and Trick needed and wanted to find out so much. But, his attraction to his stepmother had not abated even after 13 long years. And the feeling is mutual. So, in the grand tradition of ""In the Realm of the Senses"", sex was used for pleasure, for torture and sometimes, a weapon though definitely softened with love albeit one-sided at times.A great read for erotica and mystery/thrillers fans."
499,5,I enjoyed reading this series. Made my day go by quickly.  I look forward to some more books by this author.
500,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story about Marc, the vampire Sire and Blake, his Childe and lets not forget the human, Kate.  Marc and Blake have been fighting demons but Blake seems to not see it as a responsibility but more as fun.  Marc is frustrated that Blake can't see that to protect the humans IS what's important, that humans are important.  When they meet Kate and her fellow human fighters while fighting a group of demons, they are taken back by Kate to the human compound, where they are greeted with not quite friendly faces.  Marc is intrigued by Kate, her boldness, her strength and by her beauty.  He knows it's not safe to get involved with a human and sees Blake's growing attraction to Kate as a threat to their very well being.  Kate is also torn by her attraction to both Marc and Blake.  She's distracted by them in the field which could prove deadly but she also knows they need Marc and Blake's help in fighting the demons.  Blake has some personal ""demons"" of his own to confront and deal with in his life as does Marc.  Secrets that both have that make their relationship difficult.  I'll not share any more but just say this is a wonderful story and I can't wait to read the next in the Blurred Trilogy.I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: my view on this story is my own."
501,1,They left her for dead.  How can you trust them ever again.  Much different than her other books where the guys are oblivious.  I hated it.
502,5,"I've read a lot of erotic books, but this one isn't only  about sex, sex, and more sex. This book has a great story line as well as a lot of great sex. It keeps you on your toes guessing what will happen next. Its a humorous book, I laughed through the whole trying. . One of the best books ive ever read!!!!!!!!"
503,4,"Alison Paige takes the classic ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and turns it into an erotic urban fairy tale with ""Little Red and the Wolf."" Red is actually Maizie Hood, owner of Red Hood Bakery. Wolf is Gray Lupo, a werewolf who owns a wildlife preserve that boarders Granny's land. He's also a successful businessman.The first time the two met was after a car accident where he saved Red's life but lost his wife. She was a little girl and from then on, Granny has kept her away from the woods. Seeing her would be too painful for wolf. Now that Granny's  health is failing, there's a threat and Red isn't sure she can trust the big bad wolf.As a fan of classics made into romance stories, this one appealed to me. The story as a whole was well done, but I had issues with the voices of Lupo and Chadwick. Neither sounded like Wall Street types and that's what they were--powerful businessmen. For this reason, I couldn't give the book a perfect rating."
504,5,"I have just finished reading Robert Walker's ""Children of Salem"". It is late night and I am tired, but I would like to present my impressions while they are fresh. As with every book of Mr. Walker's that I have read, this one positively reeks of in-depth research brought to life in a compelling story. Mr. Walker has the ability to create three dimensional characters that breathe life into history. Throughout this book, the reader is drawn into a world where the separation between church and state is nearly non-existent and superstition and religion, as motivators, are a way of life.This book is an excellent historical novel tinged heavily with an everyday horror, not of monsters or things that go bump in the night, but of greed instigated, mindless cruelty of society against individuals."
505,3,"The story really needed to be longer, just as I'm starting to get to know and like these characters, they're gone and the story is over. And yes, a few plot points could have been fleshed out more, it would have made the story so much more enjoyable.The author is definitely a good writer, they just need to write more!"
506,5,This book has become number two. Just below the Bible. on my list of favorites. I did not want it to end.There is not a reason for me to repeat any of what the other reviews have written so I will just advise you to read this romantic book.
507,4,"I liked the book, but I ended up skipping a bit just because it got dull at parts. I don't think I missed anything for doing so either.That said, its a good read. I would have this one on my bookshelf."
508,3,"This was just ""okay.""  I felt Showalter sped through this short story and didn't give the characters enough time and care.  I was bumming she seemed to have hurried through this short story because none of her other books are like this.  She writes well, she has some very fun and new ideas...and I'm just sorry this book didn't get all of her attention!"
509,4,"In Seven Days From Sunday, M.H. Sargent, builds credible characters in a complex, fast-paced plot. What made the people of this great book stand out was their vulnerability. One possibly critical fault in the structure of spy thrillers remains superhero expectations on the part of readers. This author builds on what this reader remarks as a growing narrative style in a nascent niche in the thriller/spy market, namely reality-based characters.The story bounces around a linear, one-week-to-solve-it-all scaffold. Characters, such as the maintenance man evolving into a professional photojournalist, grow more and more human with every new scene that they populate. The terrorists engender the reader's hatred not only by their ruthlessness, but also by the clever way that the author contrasts some of the good guys' hopes and desires to the callousness of the bad guys.The plot revolves around an action-packed series of events in Bagdad, Iraq reminiscent of a blockbuster film starring Matt Damon. Spoilers keep me from going into detail, but the mood reminds this reader of the mood of The Little Drummer Girl by John LeCarr&eacute;, though paced a little more on `crack'."
510,5,"This book had me from the very first page. From the very first time that I read an Arthurian tale I was hooked and have been searching for stories about Arthur and his times, this book does not disappoint. Cale is a great alpha who knows just what he wants and is not afraid to go after it. Sorcha is a strong willed and smart woman. As she struggles with understanding her feelings for Cale Sorcha rides a roller coaster of emotions and bring the reader along for the ride. The two play off of each other well and make a great couple. I loved the fierce determination of Cale and his unmoving faith in Sorcha and their love for each other. The bond of love and trust that these two form is a wonderful read.Sydney Somers knows how to pull a reader into the mystical world of shifters and magic, keeping you entertained all the way to the end. With unexpected twists and turns this book was a great read. I am eagerly awaiting the next in this series. This author has quickly become an automatic buy for this reader. - Gabrielle"
511,4,"I'm a fairly new fan to dystopian fiction. In Haven by Justin Kemppainen ""No action is without consequence"". This couldn't be truer for Kaylee who is caught in the middle of a war that is brewing between the Citizens and Elijah, the slumlord king.In this post-apocalyptic nightmare, it is truly a struggle to survive unless you are a Citizen. If you are a Citizen you are well-fed, well-sheltered, well-clothed and healthy. To be a Citizen is to live separate from the filthy and downtrodden, the disease ridden and the poor. To not be a Citizen is to fight to survive. Danger lurks around every corner in many guises; murder, starvation, disease, exposure to elements and lack of basic necessities.The struggle between classes is reminiscent of times past and present; a different setting, certainly, but it smacks of the same prejudice that has always existed whether it be racial, social etc... of course, In Haven it is much more extreme.I like the way the author integrated it into the dystopian setting where people are starving, being kidnapped and `reprogrammed' in order to serve the elite.  It is a compelling book and very well written.I look forward to more works from Mr. Kemppainen. I'm not sure if there is a sequel in the works or not. If so, I'll definitely read it or anything else he writes."
512,5,"Not one for very graphic gore I was doubtful when my co-worker said this was a must read if I ever wondered what would happen if two seriously crazy sickos met up. I downloaded it and was intrigued by the concept of why the authors wrote it. It was a fast paced story that left me going ""Ugh, gross, no way..omg""... all the way through it. I am pleased to say I am now a fan of the authors, their ability to yank you into the perspective of their killers is amazing. It was a fast paced read that left me entertained in a very disturbing manner, but entertaining none the less. I recommend this to any who enjoy a nice bit of horror to pass the day."
513,5,Emily and Jake `s adventure in discovering  a forever kind of love was heartwarming.  When Emily decides to have a life outside of work the problems and fireworks begin.  Jake resists a forever relationship so often that he has the lines down pat that is until his sparrow takes flight first.  Absolutely loved hearing Jake's thoughts.
514,4,"I love how Dave Emberson breaks down Kindle procedures into clear steps, just like making an omelet. Do this, then do that.  If you follow his steps, you'll serve up a tasty banquet of new ways to enjoy your new Kindle. It's well worth the price, and his is a guide which I still consult often.  Dave is also updating his book frequently, which is an additional benefit of buying it, as well as a great example of the benefits of Kindle reading versus print.I interviewed Dave by telephone for the October 31, 2008 episode of my weekly audio podcast, The Kindle Chronicles.

515,3,"Candice Warner lived in fear.  She had never known a fear so paralyzing until the day she was raped, and now it was her constant companion.  She had trouble being around strangers, but couldn't be around men at all.  She was working out with Lacey at the gym when she had a panic attack, and was mortified that Lacey's brother Blade Vaughn was there to witness it.  A group of guys tried to hit on her, and she freaked out.  He stepped in because he thought they were harming her, but was confused when he discovered otherwise.  Lacey stepped in and helped her get away without any more additional trauma.Blade had wanted Candy for longer than he cared to remember.  He didn't know her well, but had wanted to remedy that situation.  He thought he might have an opportunity at the gym, but after her episode, it was impossible.  When he asked Lacey what had caused her severe reaction, she was completely tight lipped, and told him to ask her himself.  Blade couldn't let it go, and when he found himself at her home for the first time, he wasn't sorry he was there, but only sorry for the circumstance.  He could see instantly that she was beyond uncomfortable with his spontaneous visit.  After some coaxing, he finally got her to confide in him.  Blade had never been so horrified or angry after hearing her story.  He couldn't believe someone would take advantage of someone as beautiful as Candy.  It took some persuading, but he convinced her to give him, and them a chance.Candy has lots of baggage, and emotional trauma to overcome, but what a great guy she has in Blade to help her over any hurdles.  He is loving, and most important, patient.  Their story is sweet.  Although I found this story more enjoyable than the first in this series, it ended a bit abruptly."
516,5,The Knife's Edge is the perfect short story to wet your appetite. It leaves you wanting more. Be prepared to fill you kindle with more of Stephanie Drays books. She'll leave you with a craving only she can meet.
517,5,Again with this author's books some of the formatting is off.  This isn't the fault of the author.  The book is really good.  Lots of emotion and can really relate with the characters.
518,5,This was the best collection of stories.. I loves each story the same.. This is the 1st I've read from any of these authors and it definitely won't be my last.. Off to read hell cop 2 !!

522,5,"A great little chapter to read on my Kindle, but not necessarily worth the price. It would have been a nice addition to The Courtship of Princess Leia or an add on to Tatooine Ghost. I liked it, but when it doesn't even rate being published as a paperback; an avid Star Wars fan you will need to be to download and read this eBook."
523,4,"GOD LAUGHS WHEN YOU DIE: Mean Little Stories from the Wrong Side of the Tracks - that's enough of a title tied with a terrific cover art borrowed from Hieronymus Bosch to make any inquisitive mind pick up this book.  The fact that it is the debut outing of classy actor Michael Boatman adds to the impetus, but it is the settling in with these nine weird short stories that  makes the reader realize that here is a new writing talent in the making.  The stories could be read aloud and be considered as performance art, so full of wild imaginings and colorful creations, at times repulsively detailed explorations of body cavities and characters who drop in like gargoyles to keep the eye and the senses alert.Where Boatman finds these ideas it at once curious and frightening.  Yet he is able to tell the stories with a superb vocabulary that seems to ooze from the page like a jellied corpse attempting to rise.  There is a lot of violence here, yet controlled with a sense of building tension for the reader to quickly turn the page for more detail.  His 'characters' are flat like comic book figures - until they speak or do perverse and nasty deeds, and then they are strong enough to resemble memories from bad dreams or dyspepsia.Sounds like a book that might be more than the average reader could swallow?  Maybe.  But it is definitely an art form looking for an incarnation and Boatman seems to be able to open and close each of the fairly brief stories like an able craftsman.  If the 'book' feels dissociative, then that may be part of the purpose of choice of format.  Whatever Michael Boatman has created here begs for development into a novel state, and perhaps being committed to a full-length book on one topic would hone the ideas and imagination with the skills he so obviously has at hand.  Try it - but leave the night light on... Grady Harp, September 07"

526,5,"Dylan's life has been difficult since he became a werewolf.  He was forced to do things he is not proud of.  When he gathered the courage to save his friend and defy his first Alpha he sought sanctuary with the Red Rock Pass wolves.  He has saved many lives but still feels the guilt of past deeds.Sasha is a witch--well, a witch-in-training--who was forced to step up when her mentor was killed.  The wolves of Red Rock aren't particularly fond of witches and Sasha can feel the hate.  The Alpha, Gavin has welcomed her but she still doesn't feel any acceptance from the rest of the pack.  There is an exception though, when she is around Dylan she feels anything but hate.  He makes her feel things she has never before experienced.Sanctuary is under attack, there is a war brewing and the wolves are going to need every ally they can get.  It appears vampires have joined forces with their enemies and they want to get rid of sanctuary.  Sam the Alpha's mate becomes a casualty and only Sasha can help.  Dylan and Sasha will go on an incredible journey to attempt to defeat the enemy.  Will they find love along the way? Can they survive in a world where Sasha is hated?  Will Sanctuary survive the evil that wants to eradicate it?Sanctuary's Price is an exciting read, a page-turner!  I could not put it down I was dying to see how Dylan and Sasha maneuver in this world, if they could overcome their circumstances to thrive together.  Moira Rogers has created a world with amazing characters you can't help but become attached to.  With unique plot lines that flow amazingly through each book.  I have become a big fan of the Red Rock Pass series.  It is not totally necessary to have read the first two books in the series but it does help, especially concerning familiarity with all the characters and why they act certain ways.  I believe Dylan and Sasha are my favorite couple from the series.  They both have these wonderful backgrounds full of strife that have molded them into strong amazing people determined to take care of everyone else. Yet neither realizes just how strong they can be.  Together Dylan and Sasha may find out how much strength they have if they can learn to lean on someone else.  Sanctuary's Price is a sweet, satisfying adventure.MirandaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
527,5,"The Jynx is the 4th novel I've read in my Kenneth C. Crowe marathon.  Once again I enjoyed the story.  A small bit of the supernatural does not deter me from awarding a well deserved 5 stars. A common man with somewhat uncommon intelligence seems to get into situations that can elevate him into  a life of celebrity  Crowe's protagonist is, once again, as in his other books, endowed with qualities that make him likable to this reader.  These are not serials.  Each stands on its own and the characters are fresh and exclusive.  I cannot identify a moral to this story, just as I can't say that there are no similarities with his other storylines; the ones I've read featuring a clean living protagonist whose politics lean a bit to the left and who are not adverse to a roll in the hay with a lusty female.  There's manipulation, greed, lies, and deceit. Jynx comes closest to &#34;he lived happily ever after&#34; ! ! !"
528,3,"ePistols at Dawn started with a hiss and a roar. Quick and cleverly written with witty dialog and characters that had me laughing my behind off, it was snarky and funny and then kinda fell flat for me in the 2nd half. Which I guess was a little disappointing as the 1st half read SOOOOO beautifully. Like blindingly clever!! Nice characters and loved the long hair. Just wanted more in the ending I think."
529,3,"Dylan and Sasha are two wounded souls who feel out of place at Red Rock. Dylan is surrounded by alpha males and females and feel as though he doesn't contribute anything to his new pack. Even though he killed Alan Matthews, he continues to feel guilty about putting Abigail and Brynn and the people of Red Rock in harms way. Sasha is a witch. Werewolves and witches have a long history and do not trust each other. Even though Sasha helps defeat Alan Matthews and his pack, the people of Red Rock still don't trust her.I loved the relationship between Dylan and Sasha. They both saw themselves as a hindrance to people where in fact, they were both a great help. Dylan isn't an alpha male but his protective instincts kick into gear when he's around Sasha. The attraction is mutual and they get to explore that attraction when they are sent on assignment by their Alpha Gavin. Dylan is very careful not to do anything that would scare Sasha. Sasha is stronger than he thinks. Maybe a little skittish considering what she's been through, but definitely strong.Sanctuary's Price is a good read. I think this may be my favorite book out of the series only because you see the natural progression of Dylan and Sasha's relationship starting with the first book. Dylan is sensitive without being wimpy and Sasha is scared and vulnerable without being whiney."

I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also, I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"

537,5,"Ahh Maggie Shayne.  All those years ago, back when the imprint was Silhouette Shadows, Eric Marquand stole my heart.  The first book I ever read to make a vampire the romantic lead, you kicked off a genre that has exploded and will not be stopped.  Truly groundbreaking, I thank you so much for leading the way and clearing a path for more.If you haven't read these books, DO SO NOW!A human can only become a vampire if they contain a rare blood antigen, and each vampire has one human with the antigen (a chosen) whom they feel drawn to protect.  A government agency, DPI (department of paranormal investigations), is out to capture and make lab rats out of every vampire possible and they're not above using The Chosen to do it.  And if they can't capture, they don't hesitate to kill.With this series, you get a complete story of two characters in each book, but we still get to reacquaint ourselves with some of our favorites along the way.Having read these books as a teenager, I was hesitant to reread them as an adult.  So many books that I loved back then fail to resonate with me now.  Wings in the night did not disappoint and I was enthralled once again.I truly believe that without this series, we would have no Twilight, no Midnight Breed, and no Blackdagger Brotherhood.  I'm not saying Wings In The Night inspired those books, I'm saying Wings In The Night created the genre and made it popular."

But when the trainer assigned to her is unable to make it, gym co-owner Landon Barnes can't believe his luck. The student teacher he had a crush on all those years ago is in his gym, looking for a trainer, and he plans on being that trainer.There is an instant attraction between Gloria and Landon, despite the six-year age difference. Gloria is hesitant, because of her size and age; but Landon sets out to woo the woman he wants, and he won't take no for an answer.All Worked Up is a romantic tale of that proves love knows no size, age or color difference. I loved Landon, who was determined to prove to Gloria that he loved her. Gloria is a very realistic character that I think any woman over the age of thirty-five will identify with. I loved the way they blended together.There was one little spot that threw me though. Given the romantic flow of the storyline, the hero used a word during a love scene that pulled me out of the story. It took a few minutes for me to recover, but I did. And, even though that bothered me, I couldn't stop thinking about the love the two shared, and how Landon didn't force himself, or the situation. That redeemed him in my eyes.All Worked Up is a story for the romantic soul in a romance reader.AmeliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
541,3,"I gave this book three stars based solely on the fact that it was well written, meaning that grammar and spelling were on point and that the story flowed fairly well. But for me, I think basing this book on the Disney story of beauty and the beast was a bit juvenile. As were parts of the story. Things came to a head much too quickly for it to have been believable and the heroine going from, &#34;I hate this guy&#34; to &#34;well, I guess I can give him a chance&#34; was too much for me to take in. Overall, I thought this book was corny beyond belief and makes me wonder if other books the author has written as like this one. Honestly, the hero tells the heroine, &#34;teach me how to heal.&#34; Seriously?! It's a bit much to take."
542,1,"I don't know what others read (those who gave it a high rating) but I definitely didn't read that book. My book was confusing. It's like you have to start with book one. So my suggestion is that it only be sold as a group because you can't pick up one and follow the story. I don't like to read a book and it's like I just joined a conversation and I don't know what the heck we're talking about or why.Now this is just my opinion but I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. It took me forever and three more years to finish. Therefore it gets a no, no, and heck fire NO rating.By the way, I've read other books by this author and I've enjoyed them. But I definitely did not enjoy ""A Lover's Worth - Ramsey V""."
543,2,The writing doesn't go deep enough. I was disappointed to only get a surface view. I wanted more than just a snapshot I wanted to connect more deeply than just a telling of events. Anyone can tell someone what happened not everyone can make you feel like you are living it. While the sexy parts of the book are good they don't make up for a lack of depth in story building or characters.  While erotica is about the sexy stuff I expect a little more.
544,3,"The story is well plotted and provides an interesting surprise ending.  The problem is character development.  Although the author provides detailed cast information at the beginning, the people do not live up to the plan.  Men are cardboard characters.  Tom is a mystery, never fully developed or explained.  Jeremy is the weakest of the men, portraying no appealing qualities deserving of such intense love as Sabrina exhibits toward him.  Or is struggling Sabrina that desperate?Too much of the plot goes astray amidst the proliferation of nuisance details &#8230;like why did Aggie not worry about her lost purse?Aggie, the lead character, is a perpetual victim, not only of the plot&#8217;s main mystery &#8211; including the deaths &#8211; but also her health.  When she &#8220;doesn&#8217;t feel quite right,&#8221; she convinces her doctor to test for celiac disease.  Where did she get that idea?  And why did her doctor jump to a conclusion so quickly?  Blood testing may indicate a tendency toward celia problems, but a complete diagnosis requires a biopsy of the small intestine.  Aggie never had that.  People who launch gluten-free diets for reasons other than celiac disease open themselves to dietary deficiencies that often do more harm than gluten.  Even so, her recipes using white rice flour are good.  Personal note:  I have found an extra egg helps prevent crumbling in breads or cakes, without the obnoxious taste of guar gum and other gluten substitutes.The author certainly needs an editor or an astute proof-reader.  Grammar and punctuation errors abound, such as in being &#8220;late for him and Aggie&#8217;s date.&#8221;  There are comma-spliced sentences, misplaced apostrophes, and other errors such as setting off a name with a comma without adding the second comma.This had the makings of a five-star book, but I&#8217;m feeling generous in giving it three."
545,5,"The Classmate Murders, by Bob Moat had me squirming deeper into my recliner and reaching for my bag of Oreos by the end of chapter one. Jim Richards, Moats fictional senior sluith, pulled me into his easy going, semi slothful life-style and made me feel comfortable and welcome in his parent's home, as he discovered that a classmate from forty years earlier had been murdered. Jim's  life of acceptance of growing old, and his prospects for the future not the best for a man his age, melted away in an instant of sentement and memory at the loss of his friend. Jim's mental gears start to turn slowly as he ponders why the dead person had reached out to him in her final moments of life: Him,the class nerd, him the shy unassuming class photographer, him, always invited, but never missed if he didn't show. A cunning and methodical mind is quickly revealed as he searches for answers. When the second classmate is murdered, Jim is up to his not-so-slim waist in mystery and intrigue, always two steps behind the murderer. When the body of a third friend shows up, Jim has picked up enough clues through bird dog tenacity,and a hound's sense of smelling out trouble,that he has a suspect in his sights and is zeroing in for the bust. Suddenly, the hunt turns and Jim is the target, possibly the next victim, or so he suspects, but the real target is the new love in his life, Penny, the girl that had a secret crush on Jim when they were in High School. Jim is caught off guard that such a beauty would have any interest in him, backin the day, and even now, when she reveals her long hidden secret of love for Jim. In spite of this new-found love late in life, Jim stays focused on finding the murderer. What happens next is close up tangles with the murderer, Shoot outs, high speed chases, close calls for Jim and Penny. The last chapter had me pacing my den floor, oreo crumbs trailed behind me, the sun peeking in through the closed blinds...thank God for sick days. By 9:00 A.M. I was downloading Moats,Show Girl Murders,with Jim and Penny in Las Vegas."
546,5,"Let me tell you a little bit about Tia Fanning's Oriana and the Three Werebears, which is a Tia's take on the Fairy Tale Goldielocks and the Three Bears. This story is about three reclusive and secretive brothers who happen to live in a reserve in Kodiak, Alaska. Three seriously hot, sexy and deliciously naughty brothers who ALSO happen to be shape shifters working for the government and who are all in need of a woman. Thing is that they have decided that only one woman will be able to satisfy all of them, and she will be their ONE. They turn into Kodiak bears, all shifters for generations unexplained and Goldilocks is none other than Oriana, a fetish model turned Veterinarian turned pilot. Her father's passing tore Oriana up as she gave her up life to come back home and care for him in his last dying months. Knowing that he wanted her to take over his business as an Alaskan pilot she did just that, until one day things went horribly wrong, almost resulting in her death by freezing out in the Alaskan wilderness. But what do you know, she stumbles upon a bunker and works her way in to find food waiting for her on the table and a warm bed to welcome her weary and beaten up body.The brothers come home to find her sleeping in the youngest, Jon's bed and it is love at first sight for him. He is the youngest and the jokester of the bunch. Never taking anything too seriously, but Oriana soon finds out that Jon is very serious in the bedroom, seriously dominant. Without a doubt I found his relationship with computer geek brother Jordan absolutely the most entertaining, so comical, I laughed out loud a couple of times their hilarious banter captures the essence of both brothers and their distinct personalities. Jordan is a little more hesitant, but knows in his heart there is something about this strange woman that he can't control. So many feelings that he tried to repress and be his ever so scientific and practical self! Then there is Jack the eldest and the den leader, alpha male to the bone, he knows that their jobs with the government are in jeopardy and at first suspects Oriana could be a possible spy.What I found the most endearing was that Oriana accepted, although at sometimes with a lot of self doubt, that there was something strange going on with these three. How could she feel so attracted and generally just like all of them so much. And it only complicates things when she can't help but let all her feelings and desires take control. What happens next with three beautiful and powerfully sexy and sensual men will change her world forever. But they are keeping a secret from her that could make her run back home fast. That they are werebears, do they trust her, do they scare her to death? Only one way to find out! And what fun, Tia Fanning has created such a truly FUN and Sexy, Sexy, Sexy story that I was completely transfixed into their world. And truly sorry the story has ended, frankly I just wanted more with such captivating characters and sensual scenes I couldn't get enough!"
547,5,It took them long enough to realize they were perfect match. Which I guess if your balance came not from the traditional two but three you would question that.
548,5,"I don't know why I like this book as I normally don't read this kind.  It does have a mystery to it.  I think I like it because not only is it well written but it continued to move on & not get lost in describing in extreme detail the area, buildings, etc. It had one little surprise near the end regarding Gonz & also the doctor.  This book shows what I feel real people would think or react.  There's no sex & only 1 area that had a swear word.  There is a lot of killing & that's described pretty good, so if you have a weak stomach this would not be the book for you as it's about terrorism.  I liked this book so much I'm now reading the 2nd book & purchased all the others."
549,2,"Petty, angry girls, handsome forgiving, long-suffering suitors, ...this book is aimed at the under 15 crowd with a transparent plot and conclusion."
550,4,"I liked this book.  Book had editing issues, but they weren't too distracting.  Story is about Macy and Sean.  Macy has been the secretary to veterinarian and single hunk bachelor Sean Mathis.  Before Christmas, Macy finds herself in a little bit of a situation when her family wants her to come home.  They have issued an ultimatum for her to bring her live-in boyfriend of 2 years Sean.  Only problem was that her boyfriend was an imaginary one.  Well, there was a real Sean, her boss, but Macy simply fantasized a relationship with him and used his name as her boyfriend so her family wouldn't worry about her.She is mopping around when Sean asks her what was wrong.  She confesses her problems and Sean finds it a bit humorous and flatering.  He decides to help her and accepts to play the role of the live-in boyfriend.  Spending a week with Macy should be interesting and fun.  During their time together, Sean is actually really enjoying Macy's company and getting to know her.  He is really taking his boyfriend role a little too serious.  Macy is forever grateful Sean is in it with her, but every time she sees him, her heart goes crazy and she wishes it were real.  Soon, the small lie takes on a life of its own and everything is out of control.Story was quick and easy to read.  It was humorous, characters were cute.  Book was perfect for something light and non-dramatic."
551,3,"This book was enjoyable, nothing outstanding, but again if you just want to escape into fantasy land, this is a good book.  I will probably read it again."
552,5,I couldn't put this book down. The rise and fall of the story line captured me.....so much so that I finished the book in less than 3 days. Can't wait for the next one by this author.....such a great writer.If I were a movie producer this book would be one of the top choices to make into a blockbuster hit.Nichols
553,1,"I did start reading this, but couldnot really get to grips with this story. So I could not review it"
554,1,I downloaded this book free for Kindle. I read the reviews and was thinking I would enjoy this book. Boy was I ever wrong! I was so bored with this book because it didn't seem to move out of the bedroom once the main characters made it there. I decided that was enough for me and I was done. I finally deleted this book withoug ever finishing it. I only rated it one star because I could not rate it NO STARS!
555,5,"Sam has lost her bar,all her money and a place to live - Sam decided life is too short so she is going to HAVE Riley Scott ex-baseball-player before she leave town. Riley and Sam have friends for the past 2 years and they have flirted but nothing more until... Great steamy short read - Enjoy!If you enjoy this genre I would also suggest;The Wicked West,Slow Heat (Berkley Sensation),Nauti Boy (Berkley Sensation)."
556,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the unique twist on Sci-Fi. Couldn't put it down until the last page. Would read anything by this writer, anytime!"
557,5,"If you're looking for a cutesy book about kitty's to read your kids, this is not it.  What it is, is a heart rending story about the lives of abandoned animals.  The cruelty of this world can truly be overwhelming"
558,5,"If your looking for adventure then this is a must read. I have read this works in conjunction with the works of H.G.Wells which I also give 5 stars. To sum up for the reader: One is the master of understanding love and romance in the narrative and Jules Verne is the master of adventure and imagination.Travel the continent the way no one else could describe, visit the north pole in detail then journey the jungles of deepest Africa. No land is left untouched, absolutely remarkable.Both books are amazing value, containing endless hours of enjoyment."
559,4,Good read an  I also love the story in regarding how one person can change the heart and the way we see ourselves. l love how Katie love him with his scars even if thought that she would dun away when she saw them. It proof him wrong on how she LOVE him no matter what he look like. She live him for him and nothing more.
560,5,When you first start to read this book you are so ingrossed in it that you do not realize how late it is.It was an outatanding book to read there was nothing about the book i did not like.
561,5,Great story about two people misunderstanding each other. I have read many of the stories by this author and loved all of them.
562,4,"When the author herself gives this type of warning, you have to be intrigued: &#34;Warning: Explicit sex, magical dresses, mind-reading rooms, and mind-boggling threesomes.&#34;This is a novella, but a nice, sexy read with a HEA, and some hot menage action. Plus there's magical intrigue and an evil person out to kill the heroine."
563,3,This book starts as a typical &#34;friend to lovers&#34; story -  a plot line I usually enjoy -  but things move too fast and situations turn out being a bit silly.I found Nick's character difficult to like as he is supposed to be an alpha male but does not act like that at all.Just a fast reading without much substance; it didn&#8217;t catch my interest to continue with other books of the series.
564,4,"Amy works way too hard as a lawyer and basically has no personal life.  The good side to her working so hard is always getting to see Justin, a man she's wanted for years.  Amy and Justin end up having to go to Hawaii to finalize a case they've been working on.  Little does Amy know that Justin has wanted her since the day he saw her.  While in Hawaii he intends to make his feelings known and give her one of her secret fantasies.The book wasn't very long, but it was very sweet.  There was a good relationship between Amy and Justin and very little drama.  Both characters were nice, had great chemistry, and seemed believable.  There wasn't a ton of information in the book either, but since the characters had known each other for years the way things happened in the book didn't seem unrealistic.  If you want a sweet, sexy story this is a good one that won't leave you feeling depressed."
565,3,"Your Health=Your pH: How to Reverse Illness and Gain Vitality is a short (fifty-one pages on my ereader) look at using your body's pH level to determine your health. Written by Amy Mosher, the book provides a lot of information about how your pH level is affected by everything, from the food you eat to the stress in your life. This in turn affects the health of the cells in your body and how well they can function. Some of the information gets to be a bit mind-boggling but it is very interesting and most of the facts provided make a lot of sense. I found to be of particular interest the section about how our emotions and mental state affect the pH level of our bodies. The author writes of how to test your pH level, the best time of day to do so and which numbers to look for and what they mean. She also gives a lot of her own personal experiences with the litmus tests which makes the book much more personable and not just a lot of health jargon. I found the whole thing to be quite interesting, especially things like the chart of certain foods and where they register on a pH scale. I don't know that I believe everything Ms. Mosher writes but I'll certainly take a lot of useful information away from what I've read."
566,5,"I can't believe I've never heard of it before recently. Nothing new or different, just an amazing leap back into time, into the minds and hearts of the early men in Christianity, before Catholicism in the 4th century came in and before much happened to pollute the true faith.. Much like the New Testament, but brief. These men were dedicated, and serious."
567,5,Loved the story. Maya Banks has a way of pulling you in to the story and not letting you go until the end.
568,4,"This is a different kind of story than I am used to reading but the author puts you right there with the kids and I could just picture the places they were. Although a lot of bickering went on, their love as a family got them through the rough times. I recommend this book for teenagers and adults."
569,5,"I read books from mostly small not well known and usually independent authors.  I am one of those type of authors so I like to support my fellow independent and less known authors.  With that being said, I have read some not so great books from independent authors.  They either needed content work or grammar work.  This is definitely not one of those books or author.  It is well written and is a great story line. It is about overcoming extraordinary odds and winning against an opponent who is far more technology advanced."
570,4,"Here is another short story that I enjoyed so much that I completed the story in a  hour. I fell in love with Darq immediately. He had all the qualities of a bad boy with a paranormal twist. The book is about a woman who has decided to take her own ambitions back after a messy breakup. She always craved getting a tattoo but was too scared to get one because she was worried about what others would think of her if she did.  Steadfast in her resolve she finally goes into tattoo parlor thinking she was going to come out with a tattoo, but in the end she gets more than what she bargained for.  I heart this book. The reason why I didn't give the book five stars was because I wanted some action. I love the romance but I like some action with it too.  I would have loved to see the guardians throw down to protect their keepers."
571,2,"Called by Blood, The Faustin Brother's Book 1How can this be book one? When it talks about a brothers mate and the second book is about that brother finding his mate?And it was way too short and ended  at the middle of something. It could have been a great book but it just ended short.Parts of it were a good build up but it left me hanging. The last page made me think what happened here? (it's over?)It dose not make me want to read the next book"
572,5,"Was worth reading. Fast paced, easy to follow. Will read more of this authors works. Enjoyed the book. Cheap too."
573,2,I bought this book by accident but was like what the heck. Its only 2 bux. But I was still disappointed. The characters were both weak minded and pathetic. And the sex scenes? Boring. If you like books about characters in love but with no trust then this is the book for you.
574,4,I am not usually into threesome stories but I liked this one.  It was very hot and very sexy.  I definitely recommend it.
575,5,This is a good story and a great start to a series.the other books will be about each of the brothers.
576,5,"so hot. i loved this book. one sexy man is plenty ,but two??? overload. omg enjoyed the lust-hate relationship and what it turned into. STEAMY!!"
577,5,I'm such a sucker for love stories with such sweet ending . Enjoy Sarah and Neil's story. Ruth Nordin is a great author and have I've always enjoyed her books. You want be sorry to have read it. Enjoy !!
578,4,"I tend to be something of a prude, but I couldn't help it; this book made me laugh out loud and feel like I was young again."
579,5,"Gus can't figure out why Alanna intrigues him so much.  Is it her perfume, her legs, derrierre, or her hair?  There's just some mystery about her.  Alanna is terrified to let go.  The pain will be too much to bear.  Will the love of Gus and the Attracelli family help her tear down the wall she has built to protect herself.I love to read Elizabeth Lennox's books."
580,5,If you want a light mystery this is the book to get.  I found the series wonderful and enjoyed every bit of it.  The Henry Wright Mystery are fun to read  -- easy and good reading.  Take time to read you will enjoy it.
581,5,I wish the was longer I didn't want it to end. She knew she loved him a long time. He caught his feelings for her.
582,3,Steamy and fun story a la 50 shades of sexy. Definitely a fun and quick summer read; hard to put down.
583,4,"Quick read, was able to finish the book in just two days.  The only thing that was confusing in the text was the pictures missing but the captions were available for reading."
584,5,Great plot and new ideas . The characters are consistent and believable. The suspense is phenomenal and the pace just right to keep you wondering but not ever bored.
585,5,"I absolutely enjoyed this novella! Sebastian and Ella were perfect for each other! And the fairy godmother was a gem! Even King Charming was great! There was magic in this story but with a touch of eroticism! Defintely a keeper and a story i will read again. It very simple, silly and fun and i highly recommend it. A nice take on what happened after the supposely ""happily ever after,"" in this fairytale. 5/5 stars"
586,5,"This was a hot READ. I devoured it and was wanting more. I love stories of twins switching places and this one was naughty. Zoe has hurt her ankle so she gets her twin Chloe the shy school teacher to meet a client for her... the thing is Zoe is not the investment banker everyone believes she is, she is a dominatrix.  Chloe goes but the tables get turned and she ends up being dominated and loves it. Defiantly a good quick read to raise the heat in the room. I would love to see Zoe get her submissive."
587,2,"I thought I would like the on-line paper, but it is not what I had expected. It did not navigate  well. I still like the print version, even when I must wait for it sometimes.Maybe I am just an  &#34;old foggey&#34;, but the e-version is not for me."
588,4,"The writing was good and definitely pumped up the steam, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart. Be warned to expect m/m m/f and m/f/m but judging by the description you probably already figured that out. I would have liked to have had the story elaborated further and had a little more background for the characters and the world the story takes place but this is a great set up for more in the series and there weren't any moments when I was questioning anything in the story. Overall it was a good well rounded read with interesting characters that worked well in the short novella format."
589,4,Who would think that dragons would  bond so closely with their knights that they merged mind and body.... you really will enjoy this wonderful episode.....
590,5,"Keeps you turning the pages to read what nail-biting episode is next!  Characters are great, too!  Definitely a superb novel."
591,4,"There needs to be an index to jump to recipies!I tried a couple things and couldnt find a way to do it, some more illustrations would be nice to as it is called 'the illustrated guide...'"
592,5,"I love this author! Yes they are quick but oh so HOT!! Margo works for a company that wants to sign Thomas' reality show Shifting Reality. Much to her surprise she wins the contest and is sent with other contestants to Scotland to a medieval keep where Thomas a shapeshifter, Mac a vampire, and Saint and human/demon reside. Neither Margo nor Thomas expect for this showmance to become a reality!! Caution: lots of hot cat loving and biting ;-)"
593,4,"Greg McKenzie is his own worst enemy.  Greg is a 65 year old retired intelligence agent and D.A. inspector.  He has derailed his career several times by blowing his lid and spouting off.

594,5,"I loved this book! I loved the flow of it that made it such a easy read!I was invested from the beginning!I immediately got the sequel!It was one of those books that is so well written that I could actually visualize all the characters! Bravo Ms Arlene, you have a fan for life!!"
595,5,CAROL DID AN AMAZING JOB WRITING THIS WONDERFUL LOVE STORY. IT WAS DRAMA FREE AND ROMANTIC. I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE FUTURE BOOKS.
596,5,"I just learned of this book from a fellow writer friend and am here to purchase it immediately. So, no, I haven't actually read it yet, BUT I have taken Alexandra's classes in the past, and trolled her blog extensively, and anything she puts into print I will read/buy ASAP. She's completely amazing. She manages to present useful, actionable writing help in easy-to-understand language that helps you to make a difference in your writing NOW. I have a billion writing books and have taken a billion classes, but hers are at the top of my list. I can't count the times I've gone back over notes from her classes, and every time I find more and more useful information. I'm thrilled she's put her knowledge into a book and can't wait to dive into it!"
597,3,Not bad for M/F/M menage. The story was more believable because the female wasn't totally without any inhibitions. Nice ending. I'd be up for reading more from Jaci Burton.
598,2,The story is okay but the book has so many errors that halfway through it I started another book. I am not sure who did the proof-reading on this book but they did not do a very good job. It really messed with the flow of the story.
599,4,"A simple favor turns into an unforgetable night.Chloe is asked by her twin sister Zoe to switch with her. All she has to do is pretend to be her for this important client. The kicker is Zoe is a dominatrix and Chloe is a shy teacher who is about as opposite from her sister as can be.Zoe gives her three rules to follow:Stay in control,never have sex with a client,and never take off the maskWell lets just say some rules are meant to be broken. There is a little Alpha male, a bit of bondage and an unforgetable experience for little ol' Chloe. Will this hott night end with only memories or can Mark convince Chloe to take a chanch?Great little quick story. Another freebie that left me happy and wanting more. Writing and characters were wonderful and intimate scenes were sexy and not overdone.*My reposted review from goodreads."
600,5,"So creative!I can't believe how imaginative and creative and freaking original these books are. Book 2 takes Vic our beloved cynical main character into a scary journey with lots of ghosts. The only ghost that made it worth my while was Jackie, she's hilarious. In a few words, Vic has a new partner and he also seems to starts getting pretty sick and stuff  and debates issues such as not being qualified for a transplant because the organ would obviously come from a dead person which puts our Vic in a dilemma. His gift seems to be killing him slowly. But it's okay because he has wonderful, sexy Jacob who gave me the wrong impression at first of being a little intense but in actuality is a quality guy who's truly invested in the relationship.On the other hand, Vic seems to be completely clueless about everything in this book. Jacob included. Let me say this book got creepy as hell. With the crisscross tidbit, I felt the freaking chills.Cripes! LolMore please."
601,4,This book was really interesting to me. I thought at first that I wouldn't like this book due to all the &#34;military&#34; and &#34;war&#34; terms but it proved to be so much more than that. I wouldn't read it more than once though cuz its a LOT to take in the first time! lol. I would recommend it though because it really is a great great read.
602,4,"I really enjoyed the book. It is sometimes hard to find any decent stories on Celtic Hitory,myths,or any decent fantasy. We need more writers like this and some awesome fantasy would be really great as well."
603,5,I've never heard of this author before and I was pleasantly surprised. This was one of those books that kept you guessing right up until the end.  I really enjoyed this book and will seeking more of the authors others out.
604,2,"I refrain from giving this a 1 star because it's a book I might not have bought at full price, and so I feel it an injustice to the author to be too judgmental. Putting a book as a freebie draws in those with no interest in the genre.All that said, the demon tale is one I would choose to read from a favorite author, as I am a fan of horror and supernatural fiction, so I reserve the right to be a tad critical. The set up of the story (the pre-prologue, if you like) was great. It tells the history of the demons, how they came to be. It was well written, interesting & gave me hope that it would be a great book.  As another reviewer stated though, the actual prologue was rather cliche-ridden with Gage and his ""lethal charm"" and Jordan resisting at every turn until she melted into his kisses. But I pushed on....As we know from the pre-prologue, Shadow Demons roam the earth. They are evil, they feed on emotion. Jordan, our heroine, is a vigilante destroyer: cop by day, demon slayer by night, after she witnessed the brutal murder of her partner and lover at the sword of a Shadow Demon.The storyline itself isn't bad, but it does lack development of the characters. Other than Jordan being stubborn and feisty, there's not much else that we learn about her. The twist in the tale isn't shocking - not because I expected it (I didn't at all) but because we didn't get to know enough about any of the other characters to really care, and so when the twist was revealed, it gave me more of a ""oh"" reaction than a ""WOW! I never would have guessed"" shocker.My title calls this repetitive, and it does become so. The same fight scenes replay, but worse - the same sex scene is basically repeated over and over. I think even those readers who love a racy sex scene would be disappointed. By the 3rd replay, I skipped them altogether. Nothing new here."
605,3,"This was super quick, easy read.  Since it's only available as an e-book, it took me a while to get around to reading it.  I liked getting to know Kaylee's background and finding out just how she got sent to the mental hospital.  I also liked how we got to meet a character in the hospital, Lydia, which ties to a character in the fifth book I just read, If I Die.  But I think the way Lydia was written in the prequel was a little confusing.  Even though I understood her character, because I just read the fifth book, I still had a hard time understanding what was happening with her scene.  I liked reading this short little, but significant, blip in Kaylee's life before she understands what is happening to her."

607,4,"In ""Tabloid Star"", which is a very good tale, by the way, we got to witness the romance of Josh and Ryan. Ryan an up-and-coming mega action film star, and Josh a beefy burly bartender at a hot local club. By the end, the two men committed to each other as a couple. In this tale, the story picks up with their wedding.The story is not as compelling as Tabloid Star, but that's not really a problem. You see, the drama was laid out in Tabloid Star, and it's there that the traditional romance unveils. This shorter tale is for fans of the original story who want to see what life has in store for our two heroes. There love is not in question, so there's no conflict there. If anything, this story serves as a sort of extended epilogue. It toggles back and forth between the wedding itself and the events leading up to it after Tabloid Star.It's short, it's sweet, and it's priced accordingly. It lacks the conflict and drama of a romance story because, well, it's not. But it still easily fulfills its original intent of closing out the original tale and letting fans of those two characters have a taste of them again. Tabloid Star was the cake, and With This Ring is the scoop of ice cream on the side."
608,5,"Ok, so this book is relatively short, coming in around 9200 words, under 40 pages.  Right off the bat it starts with a sexy shower scene - my favorite!  I don't know what it is, but the water, the steam, the whole thing just sets me off.  Here we meet Brett and Lisa, human and vampire, respectively.  And as it turns out, they are in a relationship, eleven months so far.I felt like they were really great together.  They had a playfulness, and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation.  They respected each other for what they were, and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed, Brett (and I) thought nothing of it.But here I'm going to break off from the characters for a minute to talk about On The Edge, the club.  This place is very much a character in the story, itself.  It's vampire and human friendly, a place for them to meet and mingle, and sometimes even more.  Drink blood, or ""dirty wine"", or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy.  It's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways, loud music, and great ambiance.In the club, Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo.  Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit.  Um, hello, what about Brett??  So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share, I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett's apprehension.But that Lisa, she's a smarty.  And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her, I felt betrayed for Brett, and in a very bad way.  I called Lisa some very bad names.  But like I said, she's smart.  Don't underestimate that girl, and don't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo?  He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books.  I absolutely adore this man, and his lack of inhibitions. He's tall, dark, and handsome.  Sexy and mysterious.  Dangerous.  All of the above, and all things vampire.This story was m-m-f and m-f-m.  And it was so wonderful and beautiful, and unbearably hot.  I definitely recommend it, and I definitely recommend reading it first, before moving on any more in the On The Edge series."
609,5,"In the &#34;Out of Uniform&#34; series, this one has been my favorite thus far.  I still wish that all of the books were numbered in order and had better editing."
610,5,"Happiness despite the odds.  Will could have turned out so very differently, his life didn't start out so great.  Finally, someone who had it bad and didn't go postal - somehow he waited, didn't go crazy doing it and ended up with the right Girl.  I think both he and Jenny felt alone and Will especially, like they were probably destined to stay that way.  Somehow he finds the courage to meet her and it's the case of two people who just ""fit"", who know the other is the one (and know themselves as well).  I like that Jenny doesn't think he's weird just because he doesn't fit the perfect mold and accepts him the way he is too.  So many these days have a very narrow view of what is normal and by being narrow, I believe miss out on great opportunities at life and love. I was afraid for Will on their first kiss, because he put his head down on her chest and pulled her in to a hug and didn't kiss her first, afraid she might reject him at first just because she might find that weird, which she didn't. Acceptance is a rarer and rarer thing these days and this total acceptance of each = plus for both of them.  I don't think anything is too rushed, they aren't young, he's certainly had human interactions in the working world.  They are able to be honest about their feelings and willing to work through things to make it work, because they know what they will lose if they don't. Unfortunately, these opportunities are rare in life.  Katie Allens writing captured me!  I'd love another story like this one, so normal, so capitivating."
611,5,"I don't normally read medical romance, but this one just sucks you in and holds you captive until the last page. I was sad when the book was done."
612,4,"This book is funny but some of it are offensive and could not be tolerable to some people and with the very strong emphasis on blondes being dumb, it won't sell to them definitely. It kind of feels like a somewhat laughter is the best medicine but with an adult twist. You could see and readNaughty Sex Jokes: A Collection Of Jokes That Make You Popular And Sexy (Naughty Collection series)which can be hilarious for all adults."
613,5,"I was sucked into the Markhat world with Frank Tuttle&#8217;s first novel, DEAD MAN&#8217;S RAIN. He&#8217;s created this dystopian fantasy land, that while like ours, is vastly different with trolls and haunts galore.Markhat is a Finder, a person who helps locate wayward spouses, missing people, and the like. But, as in book #1, THE CADAVER CLIENT doesn&#8217;t make his job easy. The novel has wonderful supporting characters, like Mama Hog and Granny Knot, who are so eccentrically well written, you can literally visualize them jumping through the pages of the book. Markhat&#8217;s dry wit and the way he goes about solving his challenges is interesting and fun to watch develop. The book is well written, fast paced, easy to read, with prose that flows. I&#8217;m looking forward to the third book in the series to see how he develops this character further. Well done!"
614,5,"I am completely in live with this book,  the only drawback would be that the second book was supposed to to be released years ago, and still nothing..."
615,4,"Elizabeth Lennox's books provide a quick sexy romance fix for me and this one was no different.  Her stories could definitly benefit from editorial input - there are alot of errors in grammer and story line.  Not as many as others I've read, but still pretty blatant.  I just overlook these and concentrate on the story (supplying in my mind what is missing or inconsistent).This one involves a prodical wife who needs money and agrees to produce an heir to get it.  Interesting premise.  This is their story and it has a happy ending - a prerequiset for me.  Won't be on the NY times top ten, but satisfied my needed &#34;fix&#34;."
616,5,"Cool, forgot I had this until the request to rate it came in ... this makes mine an unreliable rating ... doubt that will change the rotation of the planet enough to measure."
617,4,"Pamela Ditchoff has written an entertaining romp through some of the Grimm's stories that is just plain enjoyable.  I read this book with nothing more than entertainment in mind, and that's exactly what she delivered.  While Runyon's lispy speech patterns were a little difficult to follow at first, once I got past the first couple episodes they just added to the world.  Elora & Croesus gave great interludes - the pop-culturish references & snark were amusing.All in all, well worth the time and entertainment buck."
618,4,"This was a very emotional, and touching story. Lilly in her first marriage, had a miscarriage, a stillborn. Her last pregnancy she had her son, which was born with birth defects. He didn't live long. Her husband couldn't stand to look or hold his own son. It tore Lilly's heart apart. She loved her son with her heart and soul. After the funeral, she received divorce papers. She now works for an adult daycare.  She loves her job, and knows she is helping other families. Lilly and jack were dating, but Jack broke it off. The two still cared for each other. When they found out Lilly was pregnant, Jack stepped up to the plate. Lilly was scared, and Jack gave her his strength, and comfort. This is a book I think all should read. It was really moving.Sample from chapter 7 - His goal was to take the necessary steps to help his daughters adjust to a blended family and to make sure Lilly's decision to marry him was well thought out and deliberate. That it was a decision she'd never regret. And if he had to woo her one dinner date, one yoga class, one shopping spree at a time, he'd do it gladly.Sample from chapter 8 - ""The baby could have so many things wrong, it would never be able to leave home and might need machines to stay alive."" ""That sucks."" Yes, it did. ""I have to go, sweetie."" Lilly patted Miranda's shoulder. ""Please don't tell anyone about the baby until I say you can. Okay?"" ""My mother doesn't tell people about me, either."" ""I can't believe that,"" Lilly said vehemently, although admittedly, she didn't know Miranda's mother. Her sister always brought her to the center. ""Sometimes, when she thinks I'm not around, she says she only has one daughter."" ""Oh, Miranda."" Lilly could have cried. The young woman crewed up her face into an angry scowl. ""I bet if you had a kid like me, you'd be the same way."" Lilly pulled Miranda into a fierce hug. ""If I had a daughter like you, I'd be so happy and s proud, I'd tell everybody I met about my beautiful girl, and how much I loved her."""
619,4,"It took me a while to get around to this book, but I enjoyed the story. The characters were different and the story flowed pretty well. It got kind of slow in places, but I guess you can attribute that to setting the environment and characters in the story. I will read the next two books in the series that I already own and see if the story remains compelling enough for me to read the remaining books in the series."
620,4,"The book is really good, but you will probably need to read it twice.  It's not the kind of book you can read just once and catch all the references, analogies.  Excellent read and wish the author has written more books.  Do not listen to the negative reviews.  Not sure what they are looking for but this book has the excitement, length and creativity to hold anyone's interest."
621,5,"I really loved this book!It kept me on the edge of my seat, deeply engrossed and completely in love with the charaters from the beginning till the end.I can not recommend this book enough.Enjoy!"
622,4,"Ava March makes the reading experience so enjoyable. No glaring errors in the period setting. Well developed characters. Wonderfully written sex. Romance without the irritating insta-love. This book has the added benefit of seriously kinky, smutty, sex to titillate the reader. One wonders how you research sex toys from the regency period!This is a great start to the series & I confess that I assumed it would be good & purchased all the books in the series before starting to read this one. Even if you aren't a fan of BDSM, this regency romance is worth reading.Originally posted on Goodreads.com"
623,3,This book wasn't bad but it surely was over like that still enjoyed it even if it was quick. Some books just doesn't need much to be said.
624,5,"This is from my dad who has to be one of the pickiest readers on the PLANET.""This was a DAMN GOOD BOOK! Get me the rest of the series."""
625,5,"As old as this story is, I had never read it. Love Kindle free classics for android. I love the writing style and language. Very descriptive. A great author, a great sci-fi mind. Very enjoyable read."
626,5,This bundle was very well written but what else do expect from Mrs. Romance herself. The Steele men are like stone but they began to crumble all in the name of love. Always intrigued and engross in her story lines. I'm currently reading &#34;Irresistible Forces&#34;. So far it's very interesting plot all in the name of love.
627,5,"Jules Verne is one of my favorite authors. This book has mystery, adventure, and very good characters. I would recommend  it to all ages of readers."
628,4,"I found this book light, sexy and funny. The characters are quirky. Cute read. Nice freebie. Will be purchasing the other books by the author."
629,5,"Wow! what a wonderful heart touching story, I really enjoyed reading this book, the characters were so real and the storyline was great."
630,5,"I was thrilled to have stumbled across this book and I paid ZERO for it too, this was the first book I have read by KW and to say that I was left impressed and satisfied is an understatement! It was so incredibly well written for a short novel, it started quick and fast paced and ended with no questions left unanswered. For once an author does not go into such elaborate needless details and stuck to the story consistently without me losing focus, I could not put it down. This book has it all really which was a 1st for me as well, it had great fantasy, romance and sizzling hot erotica between Tucker and Mariah that never for once detered from their romance and did not make it feel cheap at all. I fell in love with Davina as well! I highly recommend this book and will look forward to adding KW to my fav author list!"
631,4,"Not that hard to figure out the mystery, but written well.enough to still hold my attention. Will have to check.out the next.book on the series."
632,5,My only dislike was that the books ended to soon. Linda Lael Miller knows how to keep you interested. Love this author.
633,4,"The opening scene was rather overwritten, but as I went on I got drawn in more and more deeply. Yes, I guessed the answer to the primary question nearly immediately, but I still went on because the bigger mystery was worth the journey."
634,3,"This is a very short story that actually has more verbal foreplay than actual spicy bits - I never thought I'd complain about that!  From the synopsis, I thought this book would be different to what it was.  Still enjoyable but could quite easily have done with a few more words, if only to make it up to a Novella.  There is a big world within this story that we only see a smidgeon of.Good coffee break book and with lots of excerpts from other books in case you were looking for anymore."
635,3,"I thought the writing was good, but the story was too gruesome for my taste. I don't usually cringe at characters dying, but these were especially bloody and detailed. Interesting premise though."
636,4,"Tarek a breed has moved in next door to Lyra.  Lyra, because of her brothers involvement, knows all about breed.  They fight a bit, she is rude to him, he is broody and clueless and doesn't eat very well.  Someone seems to be after Lyra and so Tarek goes into Alpha male mode and things get really interesting really fast!I don't usually like these shorter novellas since there is no room for character growth and with some authors there isn't even room for a story, they are simply vehicles to write some sex scenes.  BUT with this novella, we are treated to a actual story with a happily ever after.  Brava!"
637,4,I really enjoy the character &#34;Hawke&#34; created by this author. Who expects a the piano player in the bar to be a gunfighter fast as lightning! This series is enjoyable to say the least. Vaughan writes good stories.
638,4,"This book was short and hot!  It was a super-fast read for me and I really enjoyed it.  I liked the story line, it wasn't a typical template and that really kept me interested in the story."
639,2,"For whatever reason, Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The ""Tales of..."" are great in that they explain background characters. However,Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist. Also, just to note, this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars), so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version."
640,5,"A cute and fast read about two people who are different in some ways except their attraction and eventually look for each other.A widow surprises herself what it feels like to truly love.  I would, though, have enjoyed more to the story and more to some of the other characters.Adeline. :)"
641,3,This was an interesting story based on urban legend. It wasn't as creepy as I thought it would be but it was still Good story.
642,3,she was too dang wisht washy. i wd have kicked them both to the curb! i think it got nailed when the phrase leopards not changing spots... so do we read another 5 years dwn she finally gets a backbone?! aarggg!
643,4,"""Her name was Two, and she sometimes thought she could smell her death.""With that opening line we begin the story of Two, whose real name is Ashley Majors. She is a heroin addicted teenage prostitute. It's almost impossible to feel anything but sympathy for her, as the opening scene has her on her hands and knees begging her pimp for her day's ration of  smack. We learn how Two ended up in this house of hell, and she immediately becomes the underdog we all want to win.Two's services are requested by the mysteriously dark and debonair Theroen who shows up to save her in a shiny black Ferrari. He takes her to a swanky Italian restaurant then drives her at breakneck speed away from New York and into the country where, unbeknownst to her, he turns her into a vampire.Life at vampire central, although filled with luxury and priceless antiques, turns out to be anything but fabulous. Enter the villain of the story, a completely nutters master vampire called Abraham. Added to the mix are a Dr. Jekyll/Ms. Hyde vampire named Melissa/Missy and a night walker named Tori that has almost completely regressed to a primal state as a result of the vampiric change.The romantic arc between Two and Theroen does not always make sense. Although I do believe in love at first sight, it would seem an impossibility that Two, as street-smart as she is, would not only fall head over heels in love with someone she just met, but the idea that she would trust him as completely as she does just  doesn't sit well. She should be suspicious of him at the very least for turning her into a vampire without her consent.And, although most of the characters and their relationships with others are well developed, we aren't told much about Abraham, other than that he's as powerful as a god and apparently as mean as a snake.With that said, the story itself was interesting and portrayed vampires as the human-hunting blood-thirsty beasts that I think they should be.As events unfolded, I found myself alternately wanting to praise and throttle the writer. He takes us on roads that we don't expect to travel and the story itself is often the polar opposites of dark and gritty and bright and heartwarming.I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written tale involving the darker side of vampires. I wouldn't necessarily consider this book to be a paranormal romance, as it doesn't seem that the romantic angle is the prominent plot point. It is important, but the main character's struggles are what's important in this story.I am, without a doubt, looking forward to the sequel."
644,5,"Under advisement of her editor, romance author Julia Martin is about to embark on a new venture - writing erotic romances.  Unfortunately she doesn't have any experience in anything but vanilla (and even that was a very long time ago).  The erotic books her editor Ross leant her have her imagination in overdrive and him starring as the hero in every single fantasy.Over the past decade she's locked herself away from the world with only her cat Duke for company - and of course the Thursday night pizza date with Ross.  Two months ago her beloved companion Duke passed away leaving her depressed, lonely and in a funk that she's been unable to shake.  Ross suggested she make a major change in her life and offered his cabin in West Virginia as an escape.  That it's January, the dead of winter and it's snowing with no signs of letting up is a little disconcerting.  In New York when the doldrums set in she could head out to be around other human beings.  She'll be staying in this cabin for months and being snowed in isn't a thought she relishes.Ross Philips has been Julia's best friend and editor for the past decade and over the past several years discovered that his feelings for her go much deeper.  He's afraid she wouldn't be able to handle his strong sexual appetites so he's kept his attraction to her a secret and dated a bevy of beauties, which Julia refers to as ""The Miss America brigade.""  Since the death of Duke, she's stopped writing and sunk into a depression which entices Ross to tempt her into making some major changes in her life and hopefully a big part of those changes will involve the two of them and tangled sheets.Julia thinks she'll be at the cabin all alone until Ross arrives bringing supplies and a few other odds and ends. While she's certainly happy to see him the reason for his arrival isn't at all clear.  She's not really buying that he came out there concerned for her well being because of the snowstorm but what other possible reason could he have?  It's not until he questions her about her ideals for her erotic book that things take a shocking turn.  Ross volunteers to help her with her erotic research and he's fully prepared to introduce her to all sorts of wickedly exciting ideas.  Julia isn't at all convinced that he'd truly want her - more than likely she's just convenient - but Ross isn't going to give up and being snowed in with him will allow them time to get to know each other much, much better.  What will happen when their time together at the cabin comes to an end though?EROTIC RESEARCH is Mari Carr's first published work and I must say she delivers a delightfully satisfying read.  I found it very easy to empathize with Julia and her self preservation by hiding away from the world.  Ross is a wonderfully caring man who has spent the past decade getting to know Julia and treasures their friendship - even while knowing that he desires much more from her.  Ms. Carr doesn't skimp on any of the research `techniques' and I must say Julia is a very willing subject. This is a delightful read that combines plenty of red hot sex, emotional angst, some soul searching and best of all a lasting love that develops from a genuine friendship.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
645,5,"It's complete, what more can one ask for? Good deal for the knowledgeable Janite or for those who possess a streak of meaness."
646,5,"Author is quite knowledgeable in the Kindle/e-reader field.  I enjoy reading it daily and is one of the few blogs I kept when I first got my kindle.  The only drawback is that the browser is still experimental, so I rarely click on the links.  Hopefully, whenever the next version is released, hopefully amazon will have straightened out the kinks.  In the meantime, I just go to my computer if I want to follow something he's written.  Overall, a good blog to have!"
647,3,"The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot, because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE, was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story, was the sex,  it was raw, very imaginative, and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story, in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99, at least this one was free. (ljb)"
648,5,"I really liked this book.  It was a little different from most Christmas romances, very entertaining.  I would read more from this author."
649,4,"Vampire family drama.  Vampires are made, not born--except for twins Julie and Marc Fischer.  One plotline was set in 1968 and dealt with the twins' mother's relationship with master vamp Conrad, while the second plotline concerned a search for the missing Conrad in the present.  I found this book highly addictive and will definitely be picking up book two in the series."
650,4,I liked it.  The story was well developed & although as an experienced reader I had figured it out the twist before the end it wasn't obvious.
651,4,I enjoyed reading this book.  Its unusual twist at the end was a surprise.  It was easy reading with not too many characters to remember.
652,4,"Purchased on a whim and was rewarded with well written little romance.I totally fell in love with this Tortured Hermit Miner of a mountain man!! The battered, scared heroine was a perfect fit for our hero. The right blend to draw his protective trait as well as a man that has not had sex in YEARS!!!!OMG! Now throw in a cabin sans-facilities- closed roads to civilization-angry miner neighbors( the seclusion alone adds to the sexual tension!You will laugh and cry several times over. I only gave it the 4 stars because I wanted to spend more time with these two characters--there were many places to get to know them and flesh out some more story........This is a shelf keeper.Thanks Mauren!"
653,3,"Sorry, I just could not finish this book. It was too predictable. I guess the best I can say is that it is pretty standard fare."
654,5,"After reading Wolf Signs, I was thrilled to know that Ms. Arend would continue on this series with Robyn's brother Tad.Tad and Missy are characters that I simply fell in love with and who I wanted to see have a happy ending. I was quickly absorbed in their story and Ms. Arend held my attention and interest from the very beginning up until the very end. But what really sells this story is the depth of emotion these characters have.  Tad's willingness to give up his happiness so that Missy might find her soul mate, is just heartbreaking.If you enjoy shifter stories, and if you've read the first in this series, you won't be disappointed in Wolf Flight.Wolf Flight is a contemporary romance that I absolutely loved!"
655,3,It's a free book and it's actually a full length novel but it wasn't the best freebie I've ever bought. The story started out fairly strong and I liked the chemistry between the two characters but it just seemed to get dragged out ridiculously long and it just got sort of repetitive on the emotional/sexual beats. There was a lot of sexual content which I'm not opposed to but it wasn't the best written smut so it did get a little tedious at times. I wish there had been a bit more depth or complexities in the story and the characters themselves but hey smut is smut and that's pretty much what you're getting. This one just happens to go on for a very long time.
656,3,"PLEASE, Amazon.com specify ""short story"" on the BUY page.  When we purchase on our Kindle we have no idea of the length.  This was a fun, racy read, but would have liked a longer story."
657,5,Fell in love with this storyline and oh my the characters simply delicious so much potential for a full series can't wait to read Leon story
658,3,"Simon must believe he's being paid by the word. He uses far too many to describe particularly mundane things.At this point I have read Henry Wright numbers 1-3. With the results of #3, I won't be back for more unless I hear there is a change in the direction the series is going.May Henry and bride have a happy life."
659,5,"This book had me spellbound, pardon the pun.  I found I could not put his book down from the very beginning.  The book is well written with plenty of action and magic from start to finish.  I would totally recommend this book as a book from teenage to adult."
660,4,"Fun read, sexy book. It's an easy book to read the characters were enjoyable and fun to get to know."
661,1,"Look, I can appreciate a great short story and a novella even more so (gee, remember when novellas were just called ""short stories"", before they found a way to write even less and still charge us more?), but I am NOT paying $5.20 for a short story. I read the free sample, and would have paid $0.99 for the whole story, but they have a lot of nerve asking for more than that for so little. Really, esp. for a digital book!! C'mon! I normally wouldn't wrtie a review for something I did not read through completely (unless it was so bad I couldn't make myself finish it), but in this case it is not the writing I am protesting, but the publisher's expectation that we are stupid enough to pay that much for a short story! If we don't complain in the one way available to us that makes an impact, then how else can we, aside from not purchasing it, take a stand?!"
662,5,"I have been really enjoying the Kindle on the I-pod this is one of my first downloads and what a great story could not stop reading and what a great price, It is one of those stories that stick with you for days"
663,5,"Everything I wrote about The Mysterious Island belongs here--haven't read that one yet, but it is on my list...soon! I like to read a variety of literature types, and prefer to switch around."
664,1,"Sorry, I was expecting something more interesting. I couldn't get past 10 pages and I had to stop reading. If I knew how to skip to the 2nd or 3rd story I would have tried them so it didn't get a good rating from me."
665,5,Very good book and the author did a really good job with the characters.  I hope to see more from this author and this series.
666,2,This book could not keep my interest. I tried several times but I just did'nt like it. The characters didn't seem to fit into the story.
667,3,Good.The female main character should have been a little  stronger to believed.  I did enjoy the romance of it.  Nice to see an underdog win.

669,4,"This was my first M H Sargent book and I enjoyed the setting in Iraq, with believable characters and a solid plot.  After having read several others in the series, this one is my favorite"
670,2,"I read the entire ""book"" which is the only reason I didn't give it one star.  Apparently this prequel to other Rachel Vincent books in this same genre is supposed to explain some of the backstory and entice the reader to want to read more.  If so, it does a terrible job because nothing is really explained and I had zero desire to read any further in this storyline.I disliked the teen girl protagonist's attitude throughout the short book, although I think she was a reasonably accurate picture of the extreme egocentricity, wild mood swings, annoying sarcasm, and lack of rational thought exhibited by many teenagers today.  I'm the father of two female teens so I've got quite a bit of experience with them.  She may have been accurately portrayed but she wasn't sympathetically portrayed and as a result I could not care less what happened to her."
671,4,"Oh I laughed through this book! It was exactly what I needed after reading another not to be named authors sad story. This was lighthearted, had just the right amount of angst and very hot scenes.I absolutely melted for Justin. He was everything you would want if your best friend was a gay man. Funny, sexy, snarky, smart and totally hot. The way he just threw himself into life was amazing. The fact that he was even willing to help a straight guy out was really sweet.Kevin was your typical computer programmer. Literally. It was so cute to watch him try and figure out what he was. &#34;But, I don't feel gay.&#34; HA!So, everything has gone to plan and Kevin has gotten notice at work for his innovative ideas. Just one problem, the CEO really wants Justin and will stop at nothing to get him.Can these two overcome their insecurities, miscommunications and issues?"
672,4,"Very good story of Muslim uprising in Amsterdam which spreads throughout Europe and then US.  A good ring of truth to this fascinating account, though some details were a little far fetched to me.One disappointing aspect of the book is that it is written in first person by woman who witnesses the start in Amsterdam, but the story is global,so the persepective is a little skewed.  I think it would have been better written in the third person.  Then the globe hopping would be more consistent.The Kindle edition was well formatted with minimal typos.  Very professional."
673,2,"Unfinished????  I agree with the other reviews about this book beimg umfinished.  The story line was pretty good amd just when it started getting good, BAM over.  I hope this is a series or there is a follow up or that is just a bad for the author."
674,4,A better then average tale.Price point is great.Easy read.Good book for a slow nite.There are some twists and turns to the story that keep the reader interested.I liked the half breed part and the plot with-in it.For the money you can't go wrong.It's by no means a great novel but well told and interesting.For readers who like fantasy it is enjoyable.A good book to bring new fantasy readers into the fold.
675,5,Maggie did a great job to have you hooked! which i was! i wont give out any spoilers but i must say i do recommend this book! the stories flowed easily and kept you wondering.
676,5,"If you want an entertaining read of almost non-stop action this one is especially for you. The Xbats fly from one troubled hot spot to another and another and another&#8230; and soon you feel the fatigue of these fearless weary warriors. The back stories and explaining a bit about the team&#8217;s enhanced techno equipment come as welcomed pauses provided by a talented author.The Piranhas provided a unique body deposal system. The singing nuns sang to the bad-asses and thusly the justified fate of the AC.Although fast paced might be a bit of an understatement, this recommended action adventure earns a quick five stars.Enjoy often&#8230; John"
677,5,Very interesting story of an American icon.  Well written and entertaining.  Starts out with the events that are the prelude to the American Civil War and how it directly affects the Cody family and Bill's life from then on.
678,5,"I started reading this book without knowing exactly what it was, but the first lines already caught me. The beginning is almost traumatic. Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed. Which happens often.If it were a movie in theaters, I would say that the ticket costed very little, if the price is divided by the number of deaths. And this aspect, if we talk about drug trafficking and especially action, is undoubtedly positive.Really an excellent reading.Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author ofRed Desert - Point of No Return"
679,4,"Really liked this book or rather this trilogy, glad it was all in one buy because otherwise it would have been confusing to try to read the others as the three books really seemed to be one.  The beginning took a bit to ""get into"" the book but once I got past the first two chapters I really wanted to see how this story went and ended.  Liked the description and how real the characters felt and gave a good insight to the fears and what happened during the times of the witch trials."
680,4,"This is a greatest-hits grab bag of 25 stories from the Grimm's Fairy Tales collection, unillustrated, and apparently taken from the 1884 Margaret Hunt translation. Good collection of the highlights, but there are more complete collections (for example,Household Tales by Brothers Grimm) available for free in the kindle store.List is:The Goose-GirlThe Little Brother and SisterHansel and GrethelOh, if I could but Shiver!Dummling and the Three FeathersLittle Snow-WhiteCatherine and FrederickThe Valiant Little TailorLittle Red-CapThe Golden GooseBearskinCinderellaFaithful JohnThe Water of LifeThumblingBriar RoseThe Six SwansRapunzelMother HolleThe Frog PrinceThe Travels of Tom ThumbSnow White and Rose RedThe Three Little Men in the WoodRumpelstiltskinLittle One-eye, Two-Eye, and Three-Eyes"
681,4,"I am a huge Carolyn Faulkner fan. There is something about her writing that always draws me in even if the subject is beyond that which I think I can handle. Both this novel andPrimadeal with a post apocalyptic society in which women are scarce and slaves to men. In this society men can do whatever they want with women -- though few remain. The women don't consent to it - their ownership is out of their control. Tria, like Prima, centers on one woman and her story. There is some pretty intense play here of a BDSM nature such as caning, paddling, and the like. No matter what her owner does Tria seems to like and enjoy it -- even if she is in pain while it happens. The emotional journey she goes on and how she comes to accept herself are what makes this more than PWP.This is NOT for any average reader nor anyone who is a dabbler - no sugar kink here. This is hard core and non consensual but with a plot and story. It's not quite as good as the first one (the story just doesn't flow as well) but is still a very good book. It is a particular favorite of mine and one of Faulkner's best in my opinion."
682,3,"Elysia and Darien live in a world where modern society has completely collapsed, and they share a secret.  Each is called by an animal spirit to help guide mankind into a new way of living.  Will they join in this new society, or try to survive on their own?This novella is a prequel to a trilogy of the same subject matter, so it is intended to be merely an introduction to the characters and situation, and that is exactly how I saw it.  It was but a taste of what was to come, to allow readers to determine if this series would be for them.  While we do not learn enough about Elysia and Darien to make a deep connection to them, we do make some connection, enough to push us on to read the trilogy.I personally am not a huge fan of post apocalyptic literature, so for me, that was where more of the problem with the book lies.  Similarly, the whole animal spirit aspect does not particularly interest me.  I think people who are very interested in Native American religion and philosophy will be quite interested in this book, but for me, a person begin guided by a squirrel is more than a little corny.That being said, I do think the novella was well written, and worth reading.  For those who read the novella and like it, I think the trilogy will be a good match."
683,4,"This was not my favorite of this series but it was darn good. Gabriel and Sarah are mates, they both know but no committment has been made. But Gabriel has made plans for Christmas. Unfortunately before that happens, Gabriel has been called as a Hunter for the eastern packs. Meaning he will hunt rogue wolves from any pack in his area. At the recommendation of his trainer he decides to wait until he's finished training to mate with Sarah, of course in his infinite wisdom he didn't tell Sarah that - men are so bright - not!To add to matters he's asked another wolf to become Sarah's friend while he's away and to let him know what's happening. The usual confusion happens and things get very confused.The storyline is not new but it is well handled and well written and there are funny happenings for everyone. Great sereis!"
684,3,I was hoping to get ideas for greeting cards.  I like to create personal greeting cards.  I was hoping to uses a quote as part of the greeting.  It didn't work for what me.
685,5,"This book started out of the gate with a bang! Poor Pearl, Just trying to go out for once and have a little fun. Then she wakes up to a new altered existence with every animal in town lusting after her. I enjoyed the fun elements. It was a quick enjoyable read and I would recommend it for an entertaining rainy afternoon. It also had some very sexy scenes."
686,4,"This book pulled at my heart strings as I connect with the afterlife in my personal life. The stories were heartfelt, and one thing I liked about them is they were not all sugar coated. Sometimes the messages from beyond the grave are not always what we want to hear, or think our loved ones will tell us. I find that spirits I didn't know when they were alive are even more candid about their former lives and death.  Good book!"
687,4,"Whew! This is a hot series for sure! Gabe and Sarah are destined mates but have not mated yet. Gabe is called upon to become the region Hunter, basically he'll hunt down rogue shifters who pose threat to humans and other shifters, and will be away for like 6 months in training. Because of this, he decides (stupidly) to wait to mate with Sarah. She's saddened by this but what can ya do, right?! Anywho... lots of serious miscommunication and Sarah begins to believe Gabe is falling for the diner waitress while Gabe thinks the same about the local vet and Sarah. Hot sex dreams, lots of arguing, a dominant werepuma and we have us a smokin hot story! ;)"
688,4,"I LIKED TIS BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL THAT ENJOY PARANORMAL BOOKS, THE AUTHOR HAS OTHER MORE OUTSTANDING BOOKS THAT I ENJOY MORE"
689,5,"Tales of love are my favorite, especially with a good story. I will look for other books by this author."
690,2,"I was misled to believe that there would be gay content in this book. There was none. Sure, the erotic plots were hot but there was no M/M. Found out that the M/M part appeared in the third book; not this one."
691,4,"A favorite anytime that I am overseas, particularly to read the editorials by publishers in the key countries from their point of view, particularly when commenting about the United States."
692,4,I really liked this story line.  It was hot and I feel like a complete sucker for two friends becoming lovers.  I loved the HEA ending too!
693,4,What would you do if several years down the road you run into someone who meant the world to you and hurt you? Alanna was dumped by Leon and turned around and married his brother. She was pregnant with Leon's child at the time. This is a short story of what happens when he see's her again. It was very complete even as a novella in the telling. I have read several Julia James stories and still enjoy rereading them.
694,4,First time reading a book about a person who can shift into more than one animal.  A good read not the best but it kept my interest the whole time
695,2,"This book was about a woman who returns to her hometown for the funeral of her father (who she has not seen in years) and discovers that there is something wrong surrounding his death.  The description of the country side was well done. I feel like the author was trying to convey a feeling of guilt for the main character not keeping in closer contact with her father but instead of being moving, this character just came across as self centered and not very likeable. The book was paced way too slow and talky without anything of merit really being said and the mystery was extremely predictable. I won't be buying another in this series."
696,5,"I thought it was a wonderfully written, hawt read! However, $8.00 for something the length of a harlequin book is a little outrageous."
697,3,I downloaded this book on my Kindle from amazon and read it in one day...not that it was fabulous but I did like the stories collected from different people that was added to the book.
698,4,"This is not your typical story, either romance or bdsm... its also not for the faint of heart.  I think the synopsis of the book pretty much encompasses the story.  Briony is trying to find her ""one"" true master after being betrayed by her previous Dom.  Chris wants her but patiently waits and gives her time.  They have a few confrontations throughout the story before he finally corners her.  He's not your typical Dominant.  His methods and needs are very different than she's used to and almost a little uncomfortable for her.  Over time she begins to understand him a little better.This story takes us, first person, through her journey to discover herself and what she truly wants and is capable of giving.  Chris is confident in what he can offer her and knows it will be enough, even though its so different than what she is used to.  ""Love"" was not the overwhelming emotion in this story.  You could feel it resonating in the background but it wasn't the star of the show, for sure.  Eventually it evolved in to that and it was very powerful.  It was interesting to read this from her perspective.  And the uniqueness of the story in so many ways was as thought-provoking as it was refreshing...I don't know if I could personally wrap my head around all the dynamics of this bdsm story but nonetheless it was a good read and did not fail to affect me deeply, even though it was a short story.  If you like bdsm stories, you will probably enjoy this book.  Its an interesting change to what we typically read.  I'm interested to read future works from this author..."
699,5,You are a very talented writer and I love your books. Please keep it up!!! What a blessing to not worry about bad language or sexual things. Thank you!!
700,3,"I liked this book but if I read it correctly these are twelve year olds. I thought the book was a little advanced for that age. I liked the heroine and characters,and some of my confusion may be that I am American and our schools are different. The vocabulary was good and if they don't know the meaning of a word the reader can look it up. I guess I just feel that the age of the characters should be older. So good plot, good characters and.  Good building block for a series but I just feel it would be better with older characters. The challenges given were overcome with the help of new friends from her new school so there is definitely possibilities for a great sequel."
701,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. The book had me up into the early hours of the morning trying to complete the book. I highly recommend this book.
702,4,"Dark Heart by Thom Lane was an absolutely magic fantasy read. Excellent world building with a sexy, servile slave boy and hot mage. I loved this book and cannot believe I've not picked it up before now. The cover alone is enough to send me back for a second look. hehe. I loved the world the author created, even though I periodically wanted the slaves to rise up, the whole in service thing did rather appeal to my kink. I thought the ending was well done too and not wrapped up in a bow. Has me with fingers crossed that there might be more! A very good read that is well worth picking up."
703,5,"Another amazing book by Heather. So many twists and turns, it was hard to put it down. It captures you and takes you on an unbelievable ride."
704,5,"I thought I had read all oh Maggie Shayne's books, but I was wrong. These were all good and very entertaining. I recommend this very highly."
705,4,I liked the story line but the editing was bad. In fact so many of the books I have read on my kindle lack editing good or bad. Good relationship story as well. I recommend it to everyone who likes to read.
706,5,"I had to laugh when I read reviewer ""Margaret's"" reference to Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolf.  Yes, that is a great comparison to make when trying to describe the relationship between Kern and Wistril.  This is such a delightful collection of short stories.  I do hope there is more to come in this series.  Thanks, Mr. Tuttle, for several hours of great entertainment."
707,5,"I wasn't certain whether 4 or 5 stars were warranted for this book.  It's very well written, but the subject matter makes for a very emotional, hard read.  As a cat lover, I hated the premise of this book.  But, it's a subject that needs more exposure; torture in the name of research.  Just don't leave this book lying around for a child to get into; it's not a Disney- or Seuss-style read.  I read it several months ago, and it's still in my memory banks, occasionally assaulting me at unguarded moments."
708,5,"This story is very short (think novella), but it it's very well-written and the plot moves at a nice, quick pace. This is a great, easy read for a few hours (especially for the beach or that plane trip).The story revolves around an estranged couple, a misunderstanding, and a cute and funny revelation at the end.I don't really understand the negative/mediocre reviews, because I personally loved this story.  I get that everyone has their own opinion, but if you're a fan of adult historical fiction, you will definitely enjoy this!"
709,3,"If you like your women hard and your men harder this is a steamy romp with just enough familial devotion and revenge to tie a plot around some explicit sexual, and perhaps romantic, content.  Something to have fun with, but don't expect great literature."
710,5,"Simple, easy to fit the Kindle into and holds it securely. Really looks like a book. I love the elastic to hold it together, but it does nearly double the weight you're holding. I even tuck a screen cleaning cloth between the Kindle and cover and it stays put."
711,5,"I liked this though very short. There was some background and although I felt like Devin should have been more of a woman than to run, Erik made sure that she realised her mistake and wanted a 'do-over' very badly. Can't argue with a man who knows what he wants and is not afraid to break down a few walls to get at it. Go team Erik! And yeah, the engagement ring fiasco... classic."
712,2,Don't bother buying. Didn't find it full of characterisation. Basic stuff with lots of pulsating manhood and orgasms. If you like those then buy it LOL
713,4,3.5 This started out good. I enjoyed the banter between Aidan and Melissa. But it became annoying when they would they both would go back and forth with what they felt. I was like alright already! Geez. Honestly Aidan was hot and sexy as hell but he love playing mind games with Melissa. She in turn tried to play and would get angry when she didn't get the reaction or results she wanted.I could have done without some of it.What I did love was Aidan's family. They were great. I loved the way the interacted and poked at each other. I even enjoyed the paranormal aspect of the book as well.
714,4,"Blake West is in Nebraska managing his friends bar for him, and trying to figure what to do with his life. He has the money and the freedom to what he wants, and as soon as Miss Firecracker walks in he wants to her.Willow Gregory is a carpenter and for the past year she was Miss Firecracker until she passed it on to the next woman up. After passing on the Miss Firecracker she saunters in the bar and gets unbelievable drunk and trashes it.Now Will has to help out at the bar and pay for the damages.Blake and Willow get together and they are explosive. They can't get enough of each other.This was a good read. I love reading about the West family. I can't wait for more."
715,4,"This case is very well made and I'm sure it'll last a long time. I agree with one of the other reviewers that they should have made the ""leather"" cover the entire screen of the DX, not just 3/4 of the screen. I disagree with another reviewer who said that the case is 1/2 inch too big in length and width- it fits the DX almost perfectly, and the DX does not slide around inside the case.I put the word 'leather' in quotes above because Amazon advertises it as being made of ""high-quality leather,"" but the manufacturer's tag says ""faux leather."" Amazon should not be charging $45 for a case made with faux leather. I'm keeping it because it protects the DX better than any other case available, but the price Amazon is charging is more than the case is worth."
716,5,The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling.
717,5,Good read and and at some times quite scary. Definitely needs to be read in conjunction with the other books in this series. Caroline Gibson
718,4,"I came across this book accidentally after seeing a TV special on secret societies. Naturally, it is captivating and extremely interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in things hidden right under their nose."
719,5,I really enjyed this book! Fantasy and religious history was refreshing. I was facinated with her spin of religon and fantasy I couldn't put the book down. I have definitely religous views but I'm not closed minded. I love thinking outside the box! This was great example of that.Some people may find it offensive but again; it was refreshing and interesting....on to The Chosen Soul!
720,5,I enjoyed reading this book. The world of the reapers is so interesting and very different. I am moving on to the next book in the series.
721,5,This is the second book of Patrice Michelle  that i have bought I really enjoyed this one to great story would recommend this book.
722,5,"This is now my most favourite book!! I was even reading this book at red lights while driving home! I absolutely could not put this book down or get anthing done until I was finished the book. It is an excellent romance and thriller. The love that happens between the two main characters Jack and Annabella gives me goosebumps. I love men in black leather and motor cycles!! I wish there was a sequel to this book even though the story had a good ending and didn't leave you hanging, it was too good of a story to just end. Heather is an excellent writer and loves to post pictures of good looking men on her facebook pages as the characters in her books to keep you drooling for more. Her books have never disappointed me and I don't think the ever will. Look for more great books from this Author The Lost Angels Series, The Vampire King Series, The Big Bad Wolf Series and Forever Neverland!! 5 star rating for sure!!"
723,5,"There is one story in this download, This is Not a Love Story, taken from the collectionReasons for and Advantages of Breathing: Stories (P.S.). So, while this download here is only the one story, and a short one at that, it is more than enough story.Told in first person, a woman remembers a time in her life when she was young and had time to waste and time for mistakes. An old stack of black and white photos brings back memories of when the narrator was twenty-two and maybe reckless. She decided on an adventure, leaving Connecticut for the unknown- the South, and there, the ""wide-eyed Yankee college girl"" met a man twice her age. She began a relationship with Tommy, and if that was love, it was dysfunctional.Just as the narrator and Tommy are characters in this story, the South is there, too, in all its natural beauty and man-made ugliness, serving as a mirror for Tommy, for those good and dark parts of him. Just like Tommy, nothing in this place ""was what it seemed, nothing was permanent, and so much was concealed."" After I finished this story, I kept thinking about it, about those people and places who have hidden truths and old ghosts, about those wrong turns we take in life and the lessons they teach us.There is so much depth to this story. It is written in such a masterful way, with complete control of language, no word unnecessary, no word contrived, just wonderfully well-written in every way. This is what a short story can and should be-- complete, short but substantial, and layered with meaning and feeling. To me, this story was brilliantly done."
724,5,"I finally read this book last month and enjoyed every chapter. It shows how they managed to survive on the island by making tools and items in their cave. This book is by far one of the best ""stranded on an island"" books you could hope for. It is probably one of Jules Verne's best. The inhabitants of an island are banded together and when they get into a tight spot, there is a mysterious force that always helps out. This force is not revealed until nearly the end. I highly recommend it to everyone."
725,5,"I read this book three times within three days.It's hot and steamy, yes the concept may be a bit far fetched, but it was a great fun read.The banter between the two was hilarious, and the sex was STEAMY!!Loved it! Definitely worth it."
726,3,This short story is a good one to read if you want to follow the series. It's main focus is talking about the different characters that you will read about in future books.
727,3,"In this necessarily fast-paced prequel, the author just doesn't seem to have time to develop the characters enough to make me buy the scenario. The writing is solid, if mildly uninspired, and the scenario could be very interesting, but it's tough to buy the whole 'spy who longs for a normal life falls in love with a grifter with a heart of gold' concept. Perhaps if there'd been more time to develop their relationship...but as it was, they meet, fall in love in day and go off to Switzerland on a ski vakay. Sorry, but that's a tough nut to swallow. We're talking about two people who lie for a living trusting each other implicitly. Yeah, right.As noted, there is a lot of potential for interesting and exotic sequels in this series, and I think anyone interested in the spy/romance genre would probably enjoy 'meeting' these new characters. I've given it 3 stars because I didn't hate it at all, but this prequel hasn't tempted me to invest in any more of this series.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"
728,5,"I loved this book. The story was a little shorter, but not super short, and was incredibly good. I heard about this free book from the author's blog and decided to check it out and it did not disappoint. The book was steamy and romantic and definitely a must read. Now I want to go on to the rest of the series!"
729,4,THE BOOK WAS EXCITING BUT IT WAS MORE DRAMA THEN I HAD EXPECTED.  IT TOOK YOU AROUND AND AROUND FOR AWHILE.
730,5,"As Gray Lupo moved Maizie Hood a safe distance from the automobile wreckage he knew that his life would never be the same.  The connection between them was something he would spend the next 20 years trying to avoid.  After the death of her parents Maizie was raised by her Grandmother who lived out in a small house deep in the forest.  Gray and Gran were longtime friends and because of a wolf in sheep's clothing who tries to trick Gran into selling the only place Maizie could call home, Gray can no longer run from his destiny and the connection between him and Maizie.Gray Lupo is ""the"" Big Bad Wolf in designer suits.  He has spent his entire life protecting his pack and avoiding the woman whose parents were responsible for his wife's death. Gray was a strong character who fought hard for what he wanted.Maizie Hood, even though she has a look of innocence about her, is nobody's fool.  She is strong, independent and a take charge kind of girl.  All it takes is one look at the silver haired wolf Gran spent her younger years warning her about and she no longer can resist those razor sharp teeth and blue eyes.I liked Maizie because she was an independent woman who was used to doing things on her own.  She was headstrong with an equally formidable will to match.  Family was important to her; especially her grandmother.  Her feelings for Gray were hesitant at first but as the storyline advanced, her emotions for this wolf became so much more than she ever imagined.Little Red and the Wolf is a story about destiny.  You have two individuals whose paths cross on a fateful evening when one loses her family and the other his wife.  Fate has a wonderful way of bringing love into the lives of people who need it most.  Gray and Maizie were the luckiest of all - they found each other.  Little Red and the Wolf is a naughty adult fairy tale with erotic sex scenes to boot.  Alison Page has taken a beloved child's story and made it her own.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
731,4,"Roane by Marie HarteI liked it.  This is a new series for me reminiscent of the Breed series by Lora Leigh and Laurann Dohner's New Species series but with a slightly different spin.  Though not long at 11 chapters, it held my interest `til the end.I want to know what happens to the `Boy Toys' Zack and Ace so I will be continuing it."
732,5,"Oh my goddess! This is something else.  This author must have smoked something I never tried ;).  I never read something so intense, so powerful.  I am a French speaking person and I was more into the dictionary than the book itself.  But I loved it, it expend my vocabulary to the max.  Naturally, as a French speaking person, I sometime found it confusing; was it the language barrier or was it really difficult to follow.  So, I was glad when I read some reviewers saying it was confusing and all over the place for them too.  But I still appreciate this book tremendously.The book cover is very representative to the storyline.  This story has strong characters who bring interesting plots to the storylines with issues such as homelessness, sexual abuse, rape, torture, special abilities and paranormal; a story that is so unpredictable.This is a book/storyline where you need and open mind, this is not an easy read.  You need to go back few pages in order to catch the idea, the meaning of what you just read.  Even if the storyline is about Jesse and Sarah who are about 17 years old, this is adult material.  Is this reality or hallucination?  Is this reality or parallel planes?  I really enjoyed this book and I would tremendously enjoy a sequel.I just downloaded &#8220;Corvus&#8221; of the same author.  I hope it will bring me as much pleasure as Mortal Ghost did."
733,5,"Very tasteful! I would definitely recommend this to my friends. It's something about having your carefully laid plans shot to the ground. Completion can come when you least expect it. I won't spoil the story for you but if you're looking for something to capture your attention from beginning to end, then The Knife's Edge will do it. It's a short story but very good!"
734,4,The main protagonist of this novel runs a high powered protection agency with celebrity and political clients.  Unknown to these he is also a paranoid schizophrenic controlled on drugs.  When these are withdrawn he degenerates into total schizophrenia and becomes programmed to attack those he is engaged to protect.  His personal relationships also understandably start to disintegrate also as he decompensates. Is this just his schizophrenia or a plot to assasinate.  The story grips throughout and is well worth the read.  Could have had a little better editing but the pace of the tale gets over these minor problems.  Great for a debut novel and look forward to the author's further offerings.
735,4,"This was a very steamy, erotic book. The story kept my interest. The characters were likable. Even though there is a three some, there is also a touching romance. Glad I read this one."
736,5,I DON'T DO SPOILERS so you will just have to read it and thank me later.This author is great.  His characters stay with you and the twists and turns keep you turning pages forever!!!
737,4,"It is a nice enough read for the pre teen crowd, but seems to get a little preachy and treackly at times for me."
738,5,"Easy to read and had a great story line!! Would highly recommend it!! Troy and Jason are a loving, compatible couple"
739,3,"Great series of stories. Very like Sherlock Holmes in style, nice details of London in the 1900s. Interesting characters and plots."
740,4,"Romantic, sizzling story for anytime! If you like a little romance or a lot, role playing and friends, enjoy your read!"
741,5,"Good story, good characters, great setting. I'm very tempted to look up further books in this series, because I love stories about rebuilding society after an apocalypse. This was a nice little novella, perfect length for a quick read."
742,5,"Who knew community service could be so...sexy?When I want a story that's hot, emotional, and satisfying, there is one author I always turn to. K.A. Mitchell. I know when I open a K.A. Mitchell story, I'm sure to squirm in my seat and root for the HEA. This book was no exception. The story flowed effortlessly from page to page, reeling me in and not letting up until the end. In fact, I found myself thinking about Cade and Elliot later when doing my own chores. But don't get me wrong, thinking about them aside, there were parts that drove me crazy and got under my skin. To me, an emotional attachment is the mark of a great story. This one fit the bill.Cade is a piece of pierced work. He's not about to conform to any standards except the lack of standards. His need to be his own man was endearing. What I loved about him was his fallibility. He's been through a bad relationship and bears the scars, but he's still breathing, still going about his life. I had to hand it to him. Many people would crack, especially after the circumstances he'd lived with, but he didn't.Elliot is the character I wanted to cuddle. Seriously. Handsome, yes. Young, sure. But in his own way, he'd lived through odd circumstances. I wanted to know a bit more about his back story and his foiled attempts at relationships, but given the length of the story, I still enjoyed learning about him. His strength was what drew me to him. He appeared fragile at times, but it merely masked his true devotion to Cade. Great stuff.I can't leave out the love scenes. Ms. Mitchell writes carefully constructed love scenes that never fail to warrant a chilled drink and the need to hunt down that special person. I felt the love and lust between Cade and Elliot when even they weren't sure the experience was more than just sex. The scene in the backseat of ""Bucky"" the Plymouth had me reading and rereading just to savor the experience.If you want a book that's sure to make you blush for the best reasons, you need to read Hot Ticket. I give this book 4.5 cherries.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews"
743,1,"Let's start by saying that when I first started reading, I really thought I was going to get to read about a female character with some backbone for a change. Boy was I wrong. Oh, she acted like she had one, but immediately lost it the second he said something. Pathetic. I am really just sick of reading about women who cow down to a man because he knows how to get them off. After he makes all these apologies and you think they might make some headway, the bad guys break into the house and he locks her in a closet so he can keep her safe. Yet he know that she is an expert shot and he gives her a gun. And she saves his butt after breaking out of the closet. For a second you think she grew a backbone when she tells him that when it counted, he didn't keep his word, and tells him again to sign the divorce papers. He finally does, but now she can't go through with it, and goes back to him ready to apologize. For what? Sticking up for yourself? And I really wanted to scream when he handcuffs her to the bed and she asks ever hurt you?"" Um...he just drugged her a few hours before, and then handcuffed her to himself before handcuffing her to the headboard so he had both his hands to ""help her loosen up"". Yeah, I would call drugging someone hurting them. I don't care if it's because you're supposedly trying to protect them or not. Geez!And when she finally gets him to agree to let her handcuff him to the bed, she teases him for all of 30 seconds, because the lustful look in his eyes was just too much, before she caves and starts riding him. She can't even show strength in that!Author really needs a Thesaurus...The word Involuntary was just used too many times. It seemed like everything they did was `involuntary'. And seriously, these characters swallow A LOT! They were always swallowing. It seemed really stupid. Real people don't do this. If you do, then please see your doctor.Then we have ever present inconsistencies. One minute he's standing toe to toe with her, then he's taking steps towards her. Stuff like this is scattered all through-out the book. I have had this same issue with several of this authors books. She really needs to keep better notes while writing, and please, get a better editor. Missing or incorrect words really kill a story. Using words like hadn't instead of had really take a minute for the reader to correct on their own. If I have to stop reading to go back and try and figure out what word should have been there, we have a problem.The only reason I finished this book is because I cannot standing not finishing a book. I guess I really am trying to give the author a chance to redeem the book, but it just never happened with this one."
744,5,"About a year ago in Chicago, writer Emerson Ward saw the twenty-three years old waif look in trouble so he took her to his home and was nice to her while Ellen Forrester regained her equilibrium before she finally left after five days there.  Now her father Larry arrives in a rage accusing Emerson of seducing his daughter and tries to kill him, but fails.  Apparently Ellen has run away again.A week later while Emerson and his girlfriend Nell ponder what to do about her pregnancy, Larry's former wife Audra Campbell asks him to find her missing daughter.  Reluctantly he agrees because he feels a certain knight in shining armor mentality towards the lass.  He starts at her private school, which leads to her friends and soon he learns she was pregnant but when he finds her she is dead.  Emerson refuses to quit as he now needs to know who killed her.This is an intriguing investigative tale as the hero is unable to stay on the sidelines following twisting clues where they take him to include violent encounters at abortion clinic and a strange weave involving the Catholic Church.  The story line is action-packed beginning from the moment that an apparently very accurate shooter misses seven times (hitting Emerson's newly finished table, etc.) and never slows down as the sleuth follows a meandering trail that climaxes with a fabulous final spin.  Fans will appreciate this solid murder mystery.Harriet Klausner"
745,4,I did not want to put my Kindle down.  Connie  Shelton knows how to create believable character which hold the reader's interest!
746,4,This book gave a lot of twist and turns. Real good story looking forward to part 2. Is Brian really going to have to do all that time. What a pity. I hope it is just as good as the first. What oh what will Brian do? :-) Do I trust Sonia I hope so.
747,5,There are lots of good jokes in this book. Most are the quick Q + A type. Some are rated R.
748,4,"Lori Foster is hit or miss for me, but usually does an excellent job with shorter stories and anthologies. She's able to make her characters come to life, even with the shorter word count, and can maintain the pacing, tension, and sizzle. These books are all part of her earlier work and are surprisingly good. I like the ""alpha"", protective aspects of the brothers, and the way they take care of those they love. This bundle is a great value. Enjoy!"
749,2,Hot scenes of a grownup virgin woman that is put in a dungeon with a man/beast for one night. Taming it and resulting the next morning that they stay the rest of their lives together. Without knowing each other or any other dialogues. 4 dl is way to much money 0.99 or free sounds more interesting.
750,4,"Well written, fast paced.  Strange how a statement can become a good plot.  I enjoy reading it and recommended it to friends.  I love a book that will keep me awake and asking for more.  The author planned his story well.  I will read this author again"
751,1,these stories are depressing and morbid. there was to much death in these stories. they were really gory too. not what you expect when see the words fairy tales in the title.
752,5,"Really excellent for Family Home Evenings, Seminary classes, etc. or just to listen to. Since they have music and words they are nice to sing along with. Often children are self conscious about singing without accompaniment."
753,3,"This could have done with a good proof read as there are quite a lot of ""typos"" however as I persevered with it I no longer noticed and got involved with the story. It is a theme that has been explored by many writers civilisation collapsed, in this case with no explanation, and two main factions survived one"" new haven"" seems to be fairly advanced and the others ""old haven"" are seen as the rebels but these are also divided into factions. The whole story is set against the battle between the two havens. It is written from a number of different perspectives which slowly come together. I enjoyed the book but felt the ending was too abrupt and although this left me wanting to read any sequel, I prefer stories to be more stand alone. I would have given 4* but dropped it to 3* due to the typos etc."
754,4,This book is very much in the style of Dickens.  I thoroughly enjoyed this tender story and recommend it as an entertaining and engaging read.
755,4,"To honestly say, i was actually going to give this book a three rating. Why? Because first it was very slow, and made me desperate to get to the end (more like finish, and get it over with), because it just kept going on and on endlessly and I kept putting it off for a few days, and the fact that it wasn't my type of book to read (the cover lured me). To myself, I'm like ""When is the end coming?!"" It was too too long. And i felt like some parts were unneeded. Instead though i gave it a four star rating. Why? Because the story was sad. I wanted Jesse to live, and not just b part of her dreams in the end. I wanted him to live happy, and Sarah. The ending was not what i expected. I thought it'd be a happy ending. Well, it did, but seriously, I wanted him 2 stay alive. :(. The book almost left me in tears. After all he's been through, and what he's experienced, and that's what he gets in the end?? Not cool. Its worth a read, and i would recommend it. :). Good job Lowe."
756,3,"Why a whole book for only one chapter?It's comic book style story, and the first chapter only barely scratched the surface of the story. Still have no idea what it's about, but at least the second chapter is also free. Hopefully, it will finally enlighten readers on what is going on in this story.But the art is very nice."
757,3,A dystopian novel that was a good read. Not many twists or surprises except a couple at the end. I thought it was a good read though.
758,5,"""If you are pregnant don't read this.""I adored Jake who has spent his entire life on Bear Creek Ranch and is now running it. Did I like Lilly? Not so much. Jake and Lilly had had a relationship which included sex, but after a while Jake broke if off in order to protect his three daughters who lived with his ex wife. Lilly found herself pregnant and having given birth to two stillborn babies and one severely handicapped one who also died, feared this child would be born having the same problems began to turn into a depressing drama queen.Don't get me wrong it is a wonderful book with a great message by a talented writer I just discovered, and I loved reading it. Just like I said...if you are pregnant pick another story."
759,4,"This book begins with a bit of history about the gathering of Celtic tales into it's first apparent written form in The Mabinogion.  While there are actually only three stories, The King, The Queen, and The Companion, one can see the blending of stories and characters  from Ireland to Wales.  It's interesting to see how once Britain was Christianized these tales were given perhaps less standing in the cultures ... but certainly were kept alive.  Worth the read."
760,5,I liked this book because it's about a couple that has been married for 9 years together for like 15 years. They were each others first and only. They separate for 3 months ........read more on my blog iloveladyporn.com
761,3,"I've read better F/F stories, but this one was still pretty good. I wish it had been a bit longer, though. For a freebie, it was better than I expected and I think it's worth the read."
762,5,this is an amazing book. the plot and storytelling is great but i absolutely FELL In LOVE with the two main characters. they are really well drawn and i felt invested in the outcome of their relationship. i think this is her best book so far. i wasnt excited about reading it cause theres little to no supernatural elements but that didnt matter. well done!  P.S. Buy this book. only a buck.  i hope the author is in print somewhere. if shes not then she deserves to be.
763,5,"What a refreshing story. Written in the style of Charles Dickens with some of the same sentiments and twists of fate that he used, this tale tells of a setting about 100 years ago, when honor still meant something and love trumped all."
764,4,"This is a great book to pick up if you don't have a lot of reading time or just want something to pick up whenyou don't want to get too involved in story. The stories are all first rate and Konrath at his best. You will love to have this handy if you're a Konrath fan. If you're not a fan yet, this is a great way to get introduced to one of my favorite authors."
765,4,"NO SPOILERS or plot summaries. Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL: Book 1 of a light, but lusty para-romance featuring m&eacute;nage up front and center, some BSDM. Quick note on the m&eacute;nage- this is about two men falling for the same woman and sharing her, not each other. Not very complex mythos, focus is very much on the erotica but satisfying in that. I'm a BIG fan of Alexander's ""Children of the Goddess"" series, so the lack of complex mythology here was a bit disappointing.CHARACTERS: Surprisingly down to earth for a bunch of witches. All very sexy, but not a lot of depth. The three central characters were not given equal face time, so I came away with an unbalanced sense of them. The story was told from third person perspective, limited omniscient on Callie- without the benefit of shifting from character to character that you find in the ""Children of the Goddess,"" so you don't get to know Tyghe and Tucker as well as you'd like. Left me feeling a little unsatisfied because they were great characters.BOTTOM LINE: This is a fast, hot read with only enough substance to carry the story. Climax of plotline was anti-climactic, but the sex sure wasn't. If you are a fan of Alexander, you'll enjoy this despite the lack of richness. I look forward to reading more of the series and hopefully it will only pick up intensity.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- with frolicking dolphins and alsoStormchild: Pacific Passion, Book 1- with multiple seaside creature shifters. Both also light, lusty reads.2. Anya Bast'sWitch Fire (Elemental Witches, Book 1)- sweet, sexy para-romance with witches, demons and more3. Kresley Cole's adventurous  and intricate magical romance series (never mind the ridiculous title):A Hunger Like No Other (Immortals After Dark, Book 1)4. Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob (The Nightwalkers, Book 1)- demons, were, vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy5. Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound (Demonica, Book 1)- demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city. Not as well written as the others.6. Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters, vamps and Greek gods. The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.7. Renee Michaels' sexually adventurous, but basic werewolf romanceHer Chosen Wolf: The Were Chronicles, Book 18. J.R. Ward'sDark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, Book 1)- also darker, more violent and incredibly intense vampire romance series. Vampires protect the world from evil. Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.9. Lara Adrian'sKiss of Midnight (The Midnight Breed, Book 1)- also darker, more violent, but incredibly intense. Vampires protect the world from their evil brethren."
766,3,"This is a review of the Kindle version - which I picked up for free.This is the start (first couple chapters really) of Zyra Zanr (what a name!) a futuristic bounty hunter.  Zyra is a stone cold killer and racks up a sizable body count in under 550 location (even fewer than this, as an excerpt is included from a novel).If you want closure, well, it isn't here.  It's a good start to a science fiction story, but the main purpose is to introduce Zyra and get you to buy the author's book.  Give it a shot if you like science fiction, but I wouldn't pay for this."
767,3,"I read this as I enjoyed the first one of these in which the hero's elder brother finds his match. In that one St John, the hero here, was the bad guy, a dissolute gambler and a poor brother. Now he is reformed and back from the war but battling demons and a junkie. Esme is desperately trying to escape her abusie father and marriage to an old and rather sinister man. She throws herself at St John to escape. The plot follows their romance. I found this well written but it failed to make magic for me. Perhaps this was partly because St John was not so likeable in the first book which I read quite recently and therefore could not make the switch to like him. Perhaps it was Esme who just kept throwing herself at him and despite several attempts to get close which failed, still did not really appear to be looking at alternatives seriously to escape what awaited her where she to return home. I cannot say this is bad, the 3 rating is based solely on my gut reaction and the lack of chemistry I felt. I did work my way through it but it was disappointing after book one."
768,3,"I had high hopes for this book, since I loved her other books. This one sadly, didn't cut it for me. It fell a bit short. The characters are well developed, but the plot is a bit too simple. The interaction between the characters didn't work for me. Tucker has a thing for Micah (vice versa), sleeps with Micah, leaves Micah, Micahs still holds a flame for Tucker, Micah goes to Tucker for help, Tucker is a selfish ass, Tucker still wants Micah, etc. I still strongly recommend her other books, just not this one."
769,1,"This is a pretty nasty book. Honestly, I think some orifices are not meant to be filled.I came back to read the description to see if I had inadvertently downloaded a book that is clearly porn. Not the case. The description does not foreshadow the nastiness within. Rather it suggests it's a run-of-the mill romance."
770,5,***WARNING*** This book will literally set off the fire detectors in your house. I could not put the book down but had some baking to do so I figured I would read a couple of pages while waiting for the timer to go off..timer went off...just let me finish this page...just one more page until low and behold an ear piercing BEEP BEEP BEEP ok I should have put it down when the timer went off but I just couldn't. This book was a great addition to the series. This book put me on such an emotional roller coaster! I was so heartbroken by the loss of losing a loved one and then finding out that they are still alive. Don't forget all of the hot steamy sex that every woman longs for. I think I will go start reading book 3 Primal Pleasure out on the deck while the smoke in the house clears!!
771,4,"What a marvelous love story.With great sex.There are two main ""critiques"" that I have ... and really, they're so laughably small because I like this story so much. The first involves a spoiler, so I won't go into much detail.1. I'm not sure why Susie's...""incident"" was necessary...2. There's a *lot* of sex. Good sex, but there's a lot of it.See? The comments are so tiny as to be almost not worth mentioning. But nevertheless. Great love story. Great characters. Believable and fabulous.Definite re-read material."
772,4,This is a relatively short book and I think this means the plot development is a bit rushed given e characters are dealing with such a major issue.  This just makes it a bit unbelievable...regardless it's good fun and I enjoyed it
773,4,This is the fourth of the Markhat books that I have read. I enjoy the blend of fantasy and hard boiled detective novel. Keep them coming.
774,3,short and to the point. writing was ok and the sex was steamy. but too short for my liking. need some story here
775,3,"The author has real writing ability; I can't stress this strongly enough.  She has what they call: ""Turn of phrase.""  But the running internal monologue of Maud, the main character, got old after the first half.On the positive side, I liked all the characters, and lots of the vignettes were believable when thinking about small-town life.  But a bunch of vignettes strung together didn't make a workable book for me.  The theme of The Muse lost and The Muse found wasn't strong enough to carry the book.I would be very interested in reading other work by this author, whose talent is not in question."
776,3,Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this book but do wonder if the author was told she couldn't go over a certain word limit.I liked the characters and the book was well set up to be an interesting novel.  But instead I got a novella where the conflict lasted a single confrontation between the two main characters and the attempted murder mystery lasted all of a phone call from the hero to the sexy security guy.If either of these events had been stretched to encompass a chapter or two the book would have been so much better.  The players were in place but the game never happened and the reader was deprived of what could have been a really good book and instead got some really good sex scenes.If you'd like an hour or so of entertainment buy this book.  If you want a good romantic suspense buy something else.
777,5,Great read hope to see more about this writer's stories from free kindle books store.  I hope the story never need s
778,5,Liked the preview enough that I bought the book.  I will let you know what I thought when I finish.  Just finished the book and can say I definitely enjoyed it.  Keep them coming.
779,4,"I had known about Leale for awhile, but had never read his personal notes.  He was in Ford's Theatre when the President arrived, and he described both Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln's countenance as they were received.  For a moment, you begin to truly understand how Mr. Lincoln saw himself at the close of hostilities, having been worn thin by his service of the previous four years.  Personally, I saw Lincoln as tired, drained, relieved, and hopeful.  The man needed to rest before re-uniting the country &#34;with malice toward none and charity for all&#34;.  I also think this book accentuates the deep loss we endure to this day, by the actions of a single fanatic, armed with a pistol.I recommend this to anyone studying Lincoln, reconstruction, or the Civil War in general.  It's a quick, easy read, and certainly worthy of any high school history class or better."
780,5,"I absolutely love Tymber Dalton's writing.  This book was no exception for me.  I enjoy following along in these characters lives and the ""cliffhanger"" at the end just made want to read more of the story.  I hope she makes another book so we can read the outcome of these people's lives.  I like the peronalities and dynamics of relationships of the characters.  I don't think it would be good as a stand alone book though.  I recommend reading two tied in stories before the series it makes it that much more enjoyable.I read them in this order:1. Boiling Point (Tymber Dalton) found in Tasty Treats Vol. 32. Steam (Tymber Dalton)3. Triple Trouble (Triple Trouble 1) (Tymber Dalton)4. Storm Warning (Triple Trouble 2)(Tymber Dalton)5. Three Dog Night (Triple Trouble 3) (Tymber Dalton)I, for one, am hoping to read on about these characters!!!"
781,5,"I love Brenda Jackson, she is the best ever. I like the way it all come together. Big happy family......(Westmoreland)"
782,3,"I thought this was a good story.  Liked the main characters.  For some reason, I thought Jane should have been a brunette.  Not sure why.  Even though i'd like to move on the the next books, I can't.  The books are so short and add the rest of the series and it's terribly expensive for such short stories, combined."
783,5,What a great book. The twist and turns in this story keeps you guessing. You think you know the secrets but the author makes sure you don't. There's some suspense & a huge secret that causes mistrust and hate between the hero and heroine. But no matter the friction between this couple the passion and fire ignites and they just can't seem to stay away from each other. This is a smokin hot erotic romance that you'll not want to put down.
784,4,"The story follows two main characters and some good side ones. Keith is struggling to come to terms with a past he doesn't like. Abigail has been forced into a world she didn't know existed while her friend Dylan trying to accept that there are better packs out there than the one he was in. You meet two Alphas that are awesome people and one that sucks. There are plenty of struggles, lust, love, and comradeship to learn to love these well written characters. The action is well described and nail biting in a few spots. The ending leaves satisfied enough but with some questions unanswered to keep you wanting more. There are plenty of paths that this story can take and it will be a great series to continue.The story was definitely well written with great characters that are believable and easy to understand. The only negative I can really say is that there were plenty of instances where the writer kept saying she (Abigail) just doesn't understand this or that, and then offers no explanation. So, I kept reading ""She just doesn't know or understand..."", and I kept thinking no crap - could you explain it?!? Never really got that many answers though - which I suppose is why it's a series and they need to do that so you'll get the other books. It was a good read and I would recommend it."
785,4,I enjoyed all of the books in this series. This one was my favorite. I recommend this to anyone who likes out of this world fantasy
786,5,Not your typical zombie novel. This is zombie evolution. This is definitely worth the read especially for the price.  Starting book 2 now.
787,3,"I chose this rating because of the grammatical errors as well as the punctuation errors. I have only been reading this genre for about two years and I have to say that this is the first time I have read about this type of zombie. I don't want to write spoilers so I'll say nothing about them. One of the problems I had was it felt like a spoof, not an edge of your seat zombie thriller. However, the characters were engaging and well developed, I liked many and hated some. This is just one opinion, check it out for yourself."
788,4,"Light, fun, sexy and perfect for the holidays.KIDNAPPED FOR CHRISTMAS is a treat as sweet as gingerbread cookies at Christmas. Don't expect anything profound or deep. This is a tale of undeniable chemistry and self-discovery as two perfect matches find their round-about way to each other.Jillian looks identical to her sister, Sabrina, who is a year younger and much flightier. In typical impulsive fashion, Sabrina has bought and paid for a BDSM kidnapping fantasy for herself, contrary to Jillian's warnings of concern. Then she sails off to Key West with her new boyfriend, leaving Jillian to care for the cat and her apartment.Walking out of Sabrina's apartment, Jillian is mistaken for her sister, gagged, blindfolded and taken to the BDSM dungeon to live out Sabrina's fantasy. Unable to explain through the gag, Jillian ends up finding herself curious and turned on by not only the BDSM but the enigma mastering her body. When the gag does come off, she not only doesn't know the safe word to stop the fantasy, she is unwilling to call it quits before her curiosity is satisfied.Kyle reluctantly agreed to stand in for the first time for his brother who owns the new kidnapping company, only because he finds the client exactly to his taste. As the fantasy plays out, Kyle has a difficult time abiding by the rules of the company. His attraction to Jillian and her responsiveness to him is just too powerful.I enjoyed Jillian's journey of self-discovery and found myself wincing each time the poor girl was pushed farther, thanks to her sister's fantasy request. It was quick, tantalizing and cute (if you can describe BDSM as cute). The whole thing was just a naughty little holiday break that will leave you twitching in your airline seat on the way home for the holidays. Enjoy!"
789,4,"Aggie Underhill is a 53 year old well off British widow who has moved to Palm Springs to be closer to her only daughter's family.  Her best friend, Betty, lives next door, as does Betty's cousin Roger.  This book involves the maybe murder of a wealthy actress' husband's mistress, followed by the murder of the actress, and an author.  Oh, and then there's the gardener who isn't really a gardener, and the ransacking of Aggie's condo.  All of this might be related to Aggie's late husband...or maybe not.  Lighthearted, a fast and easy read.  And there's a short story tucked into the end of the book, just to endear Aggie to us.  Deep and intellectual it isn't.  Fun? Very much so.  Well written with likable characters."
790,3,"I really like this short story, but it was too short. It would have been nice if it was longer and I would have enjoyed it much more. The characters are were defined, but I would have loved to see how it all actually played out. Kind of hoping that maybe the author will write an extended version.It does make a good short story though."
791,5,This novella is an introduction to the word of leopards. It wets your appetite for the full length books to come in this series. If you like reading about love action with a some shape shifting you will love this book and want to the next five books that follow and leave you with wanting more.
792,4,"This is a great resource, with many classic recipes and techniques, but it's not exactly healthy cooking.There are very few whole grain recipes, no nutritional or caloric information or guidance, few low fat or dietetic choices offered. Nor is there much in it for vegetarians. Many of the vegetable recipes contained meat or meat byproducts such as meat based broth, bacon, etc. There isn't even a recipe for a good vegetable broth that one could use as a substitute. While I didn't expect this to be a health food cook book, there could have been more thought given to including recipes for those who don't want to eat high fat, animal centric, fattening foods.So, download this as a resource, but be aware that it's not suitable for those who are watching their weight, diet or are vegetarians."
793,4,"What an interesting plot line.  Most Regency style novels and just a little too &#34;sweet&#34; for my tastes, but Delle Jacobs takes this book in a very convoluted direction.  Are &#34;love potions&#34; real or not.  Did the men in this book over react or did they use the &#34;potion&#34; as an excuse.  Read this book and try to figure it out.  Lite and refreshing.  An easy read but has some interesting twists and turn."
794,5,Unique and delightful characters abound.  I found the sisters to be particularly funny in a somewhat sneaky kind of way.  Laughter would erupt almost before I knew it!  Most enjoyable.
795,4,"If you've come down this far in the reviews, then I hope you'll finish reading.  I hope you'll also note the publisher's review that implies very mild BDSM and lots and lots of sex.  Don't download this book if you're gonna have a problem with sex on a first date, explicit sexual language and graphic descriptions of sex or people having, you know, sex.To call this a PNR is a stretch because it's way too erotic to be a romance.  And apparently it's not erotic enough to be called erotica for some picky people.  If the rest of the story is only a conveyance to get the couple in bed, in my mind that's erotica even if it's tame.Okay, so now if you're still interested, please get this book!  You won't be disappointed.  This is a straightforward story with a very simple plot.  It's not superior storytelling; I would have liked more character development on both sides, and the dialogue is not great.  But, ultimately, I read erotica so I can get jazzed up and go jump my husband; this book definitely, erm, scored in that regard.  I hate contrived drama between the male and female who could clear everything up if they only talked about their feelings or asked the right question.  The couple in this story had a problem and voila, they talked about it so they could move on to the good part.  What a concept.So, yes, the sex, there's a lot of it.  Just because nobody gets a ball gag in their mouth doesn't mean it's not hot.  The couple connected, had chemistry and the scene where she's doing the monster, holy smoke... well done."
796,5,"Wow...what a story.  When I finished reading this book I was in awe.  The ending was a total surprise and I had to skim back through the book to figure out where I missed the clues.  They were there and I missed them completely!  I don't like a review which tells you the story; I don't think that's fair to the readers or the author so I wont do it.  Here's my synopsis.This story was developed extremely well.  Two parallel lives tracking alongside each other; each with their own demons, ultimately with their own peace.  The characters were rich and descriptive and the author did a wonderful job letting you into their lives while you traveled through their journey.Now that I know the outcome I will re-read this again because I'm sure there's additional depth that I missed the first time when I approach this book as a simple mystery novel.  It's not.  Read slowly and take your time to ""feel"" the words and understand the characters. The story is powerful, soulful and honest.  Something to keep in your library forever.Thank you Rebecca Forster."
797,5,I love this story. I love all her stories!!!! All her books are with out mistakes!! Her books are some of the best I have read!!!
798,1,After reading all the glowing reviews about this book I bought it.  It sounded so wonderful & about all the things I like to read.  I was disappointed I'm sorry to say.  I found it slow going & a bit boring.  I finally did finish the book but personally for me it wasn't worth it.
799,2,"Short, cutesy, and rote! It was over before you had a chance to 'know' the characters strenghts and weaknesses...Leanne, no more minis. This format does not do you justice, you are an amazing writer. Don't sell out!"
800,1,It was too slow from the very beginning!To much information about a number of charcters at the very beginning which turned out to be quite boring!
801,5,This is truly a remarkable and gross story but I loved it.Hands down one of the best I've read in a long time.besides the other serial killers books.Taylor and Donaldson are fabulous together. the chills keep coming.
802,5,"It's been a while since I've read the Wizard of Oz, and decided it was about time I read it again! I totally remember when I was little reading it!!! I get different ideas and views from it now as an adult! So good my kids are going to read it!"
803,5,This had my attention from the very start. It is good to fight for what you love. I can not wait to read the other stories.
804,1,"After having Read wolf creek series , I was really ready for Tri Omega mates ! The first one was pretty good ,but the second one Forbidden Desires could have been left unwritten . Ryland was an immature fool who didn't deserve any mate let alone two . Once a tri omega found his or her mates he or she could not live without them as the needed the additive his mates carried . I found myself wishing Gregory could have found another mate besides Ryland who was tri omega and Viktor who was the second mate . At least the books were cheap so I don't feel too bad and I'm hoping the other two are better but this one I would not recommend to anyone ! It's a bad relationship when one person has to do all the compromising . Ryland and Viktor were HORRIBLE characters, Ryland was a backwoods slut with a sugar coating ,no wonder his family tried to kill him -sorry they missed !Not a good on a bad day !"
805,3,This is my least favorite book by Shara Azod.  It kinda started off slow and it took me a moment to really get into it.  I loved how much the hero cared for the heroine from the moment go.  A very solid read.
806,4,"Claire is holding down her usual seat in a corner during a New Year Eve's party, people watching and making notes for the erotic romances she writes. She notices a really hot guy who causes her to have very exciting fantasies. When she realizes that he and another hot guy are coming her way, she looks around to see who they are coming over to see because it cannot be her!Former geeks in high school, Mason and Hunter are at the party just to see if the Claire they are hearing about from Mason's associate Paul, is the same Claire they went to high school with and she is! She hasn't changed at all, still watching life happen around her because she is so shy. They have been looking for her for the past 10 years, they had a crush on her and they want to see if it still exists and lucky for Claire, it does.Since Claire has been making New Years resolutions she figures she might as well go through with them so, she agrees to join Mason and Hunter for an overnight m&eacute;nage. At least that's the reason she gives herself.A delightful romance, that includes a threesome affair, that may lead to more. The characters are vivid and the storyline is well done even though its a short story. I like the background for the characters and that the knew each other even though they weren't best friends. Very enjoyable read."
807,5,"Truck Stop is an exclusive ebook on Kindle by Jack Kilborn and J.A. Konrath. You may not know this unless your an avid fan but Kilborn and Konrath are one in the same.It brings 3 characters together from 3 different books. Donaldson (Serial), Taylor (Afraid), and Lieutenant Jack Daniels (from the Jack Daniels series). Two serial killers and a cop come face to face in a Truck Stop. Never having met before they happen upon each other while chatting it up Jack (obviously having really bad luck with serial killers) happens to walk into the same Truck Stop. Donaldson recognizes her and immediately wants her for his collection. Taylor and Donaldson fight over who actually wins before settling on coin toss.It's all very fast paced and exciting. I really enjoyed reading all three of these characters together. I love these little short stories."
808,1,"As I was reading this book, I couldn't help but think that if ""I Love Lucy"" were x-rated this would be a perfect episode:  Lucy on a roadtrip where all sorts of unexpected disasters befall her. The problem for me is that I've never liked Lucy. Humor based on the thinnest of plots, stupidity and amazing coincidences just isn't my cup of tea. Add in characters who are cardboard cut-outs and a boatload of unmotivated sex (you know, lust at first sight and every sight thereafter, like animals in heat) and I'm really sorry I spent any time or money on this book."
809,2,"This was far too short to develop a 'relationship' with the story.  I liked the idea, saw potential for more for this horror story about what happens after death."
810,5,Each of the stories in this Nebraska historical Romances have been really good and I'm anxious to read the last book in this series.
811,4,I would love to hear more about t his couple. There life is gonna be hard and I would love to see how the characters would handle life after the scandals.
812,5,This book was extremely incredible to read and it had so much heated passion to describe in every Steele relationship. I'm glad that the brothers and cousin found passionate love at last.
813,5,"I was familiar with the Lovecraft from the Call of Cthulhu RPG, but had never actually read any of the stories.Purchase of my Kindle led me to pick this up.  What a great deal for $2!The writing is amazing.  The ideas that Lovecraft either came up with or built upon are wonderful.  His Mythos is complicated and engaging.Lovecraft does a good job of referencing some earlier stories.  It's nice to hear about the Innsmouth Curse, for example, in multiple stories.  Though, you might get sick of hearing of the Mad Arab who wrote the Necronomican.  Seriously, was Mad part of his name?This collection, in my opinion, is front-loaded with the best stuff.  My favorites being The Call of Cthulhu, The Dunwich Horror and The Shadow over Innsmouth.  Though, the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath is really good also.Now, be warned, this was written in a time when different language was acceptable.  Some of what he says is quite offensive, but, I hope readers can get past that to the true quality that is there.Easy 5 stars.Edit - I see that a rival publisher doesn't like this review, as all of the reviews here were down-voted after I pointed out this was the better version.  Tough.  This is the Lovecraft version to get."
814,4,This book was funny. It was just like her book worth figbting for. the female character was so funny. n the story was developed good it didnt leave u straching yo head or anything. Its a must read people.
815,3,"This story was just ok. I have issues when authors include children in the stories. This boy was 3 yrs old yet he spoke and behaved like he was 10. Also, the heroine seemed selfish. She wasn't going to allow the hero to get to know his son. Whatever happened to getting joint custody of children? In the book prior (Cook and Bottle Washer) Emma was worried about the court awarding her cousin to the grandparents. Yet her brother in-law never once spoke of joint custody.Either way, it gets an ok rating."
816,4,"**May contain what could be considered slight spoilers if you haven't read earlier books in the series**This is a really good story that gives two of the characters from earlier books in the series their happy endings.Jeremy (a policeman) and David (owner of a construction company) have a one-night stand, although both develop instant feelings for each other. When David is shot at, Jeremy needs to step up and help find out what is going on. Nice blend of mystery, romance, sex and drama.I liked that we knew something about both Jeremy and David from the earlier books. I had especially loved Jeremy in ""A Helping Hand"" where he was the love interest of one of the characters and a really nice guy but missed out on getting his man! Good to see he was the winner this time around!"
817,5,"This was a fantastic read.  I enjoyed immensely the suspenseful writing on love, relationships,mystery and intriguing suspense as to what was going to happen next.  Great read!"
818,2,I love a good story and this was a good story until the end. When it finally gets good the book just ends. I was so disappointed I don't even want to read another book by this author.
819,5,"I thought I would read a few chapters and discard as a preachy Christian story, but was very happy to keep reading this well thought out book.  I couldn't put it down! Kudo's to the author for coming up with such a mixture of science and Christian history. I don't often give 5 stars to any book, but this is well worth it....and it was free!"
820,4,"Unbridled takes place in Texas, in a town that is amusingly called Two Mule. This well written novella is full of details. The characters are all true ranching Texans. Dani is a believable character, that is easy to like. The men in this book are sexy cowboys through and through. Rowe is a hard worker while Justin was always a hard player. The differences make each one appealing in their own way. The sex scenes are very erotic. This is not the story of a traditional love, but it is just as strong and romantic. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes hot Texans! - Ammie"
821,2,"This story was over before it started. The story starts off with this queen who has so many traitors in her midst and the guy is on top of that list. He quickly seduces her into a boring, too quick sex romp and then the story is over. This story took about 7 minutes, but the excerpts from countless of other stories they want you to buy took much longer, about what this book should have been."
822,1,"How awful is this unfocused collection of words? Let me count the ways:1. There is no plot (that should be enough, but there's more).2. The heroine (for lack of a better word) is a paranoid, shallow mass of nothingness. We don't know if she could have had any more depth because the author provided absolutely no worthwhile character development. In fact, what little information the reader is given about her made her very unattractive. She is materialistic, narcissistic and moody for no clear reason. The very first page clumsily recalls how she picks a fight with her husband over absolutely nothing.Sadly, the pitiful introduction to her hair is the entire basis of the book, although the synopsis held so much promise. The husband is just there so the story can have a male counterpart; he is quite insignificant. If he mentions it once, he mentions it a thousand times that he wants to get to know his wife of seven years. What?!?3. Why does this author (for lack of a better word) make them have their only serious conversations right in the middle of the awful sex scenes, not once but several times? Weird. Other than that, there is no meaningful dialogue between the two of them.4. Some of the informational points are repeated, over and over, and over again. Why?5. If this is an IR romance, why was race in regards to their relationship never highlighted?6. Did I mention there is no plot?So, yes, this was an awful read and I now know to avoid this author. That is a shame because she has so many books available, which is incredible considering the lack of quality in her storytelling.Had I gotten this book for free, I would have paid too much."
823,4,"from 1922 an amazing collection of info on symbols from cultures around the world and zodiac signs and gems.  while there are some ocr errors, there are also a very comprehensive linked table of contents and index."
824,5,"I should know better, but i always expect that books in a box set are likely to disappoint. As if authors dump their duds into these sets just to make a couple bucks they'd never make on their own. This was included in a 9-book set of murder mysteries that have yet to disappoint! I thoroughly respect Forester's method for maintaining hope in the face of despair..of keeping the reader in the dark with the lights all on. Without spoiling the story, realize I awarded it 5 stars and rave about the technique. Say no more!"
825,1,"I've enjoyed other Devlin books, but this one read like someone was holding a gun to her head and would shoot if she typed fewer than 50 words per minute. Come to think of it, that would have been a far more entertaining story than this mess.Where to start? There were sentence-level mistakes that indicated a lack of proofreading (your/you're, the ""creek"" of the stairs, etc.) but I can generally forgive those if the characters are engaging. Dylan and Emmy weren't just not engaging, they were actively off-putting. He's broody and dull, she's chunky and grateful, and I think they hook up because no one else wants to be around them. They start having sex five seconds after they meet and every hour after that, including in the wreckage of a car crash. (In the book's most stomach-churning scene, he's not even conscious for it!)Other problems abound. The stupidity of the dialog is matched only by its sheer volume. I kept thinking that only the sweet release of death would make Emmy shut the hell up, but no. Her conversation was just as inane after death as before. (I guess that was a spoiler, but honestly you won't care.) Oh, and there's an English guy who says things like what ho, I say, old chap and other things dumb people think English people say. And some dead dogs. Are you turned on yet?This is the laziest book I've ever read. The fact that it exists is either an indictment of the entire publishing industry or the proud culmination of the digital age, in which every awful idea anyone has is instantly available for worldwide consumption.Gosh, I can't wait for part two!"
826,5,"Ahhh Zsadist and Bella, I was so emotional with Lover Awakened. I am so happy to read more of their story. Sometimes I wish we could have volumes and volumes of their lives. Not just Zsadist and Bella but all the Brotherhood."
827,4,When I checked how long the book I was surprised. I got it for only 1.99 and it has over 1000 printed pages. I downloaded it on my Android and have read most of the first story. I never cared much for Max Brand but as I read I think it will be better than I remembered.
828,3,"I read the book but did not bother with the bonus at the end.  I think the book may have been meant more for very young people maybe 12 years old.  It was not very deep, and weak in the story line.  The flashbacks were too long, causing you to lose focus on the story.  It could almost have been two (2) books just pieced together.  I kept waiting for the punch but it never came."
829,3,"There is a magic mirror, a curse, a hot naked werewolf and a lonely woman living in an all wolf town. Even though I liked the bit of fairy tale magic in the mix I am not keeping only because the fact that the rest of the series is an average of $5 each. to me that is way too much for the average alpha were meets mate who thinks he is hotter than chocolate sin."
830,5,"I enjoyed Hell Cop 2 even more than the first. There are three stories by Astrid Amara, Nicole Kimberling, and Ginn Hale, each picking up where they left off in Hell Cop, as far as the relationships between characters go, and with three new exhilarating adventures featuring Parmas City Demonic Unit and their helpers. I loved it! Action, suspense, humor, and romance. I hope there will be a sequel some day soon."
831,4,"Manhunting in MS is an enchanting little romance novel with 1 sizzling love scene, a touch of comedy and it's offered at an excellent price.  Although the overall the plot is rather ordinary, it was still interesting and believeable.  I enjoyed it. I really liked the chemistry between the main characters."
832,3,"I agree with some of the other reviewers of this book in that I believe the race card is played alittle too strongly.  I believe that unfortuantely, there still is racism in this country and I understand that is what the author was trying to convey.  My issue was mostly with the parts of the book where the author decided to add in the main character, Will Pruett, a young black reporter's, thoughts throughout the book.  We get that he is black but he is an educated man who does not speak like a 13 year old street person at any other point in the book so stop trying to make him think in a completely different tone of voice than he actually speaks.  It seemed the author was trying to ram down our throats that he was black by adding these thought bubbles in and it was completely distracting and unnecessary.  You can't make him 2 different people, he is either an educated man who happens to be black or he is the disgusting stereotype of an uneducated black man who cannot speak proper english, pick one.  Other than that, the second half of the story was really good.  I was interested in the story line and the second half definitely had a twist I was not necessarily expecting which I enjoyed.  It kept me hooked all the way to the end to find out how the story would be resolved.  Overall good book and good story line but there was just a lot of unnecessary stuff in the first half I could have done without."
833,5,"this book has introduced me to two authors i had never heard of before in my life.  i thought it was very good horror and very tongue and cheek funny in a lot of places.  please people stop downloadin kilborn(konrath) and crouch books then complain about the gore.  if you take the time to read the description and just a few reveiws you should know its there.  we cant help it that there are some of us that need this elevated amount and .ore detailed description of torture to make the hair on our necks stand up.  the only bad part about it is my son downloade serial to his phone on my suggestion, read it, loved it, and now keeps jacking my kindle to read the rest of the series."
834,5,From the  Sizzling cover to the last page Minx Malone makes this read well worth the effort !.Co-workers and best friends who are drawn to each other .It makes you laugh and sigh and like a really great movie where you sit and watch the credits and hope there just might be a sequel . I hope there will be! *S*Becca
835,2,Usually I love Kelly Jamieson's books however this one was just way to short to have any type of character development.  Maybe that was the point.  I just didn't really like it so much.
836,3,"Thank heavens there is a dictionary feature in Kindle!  The antiquated language was ponderous as was the unnecessary prosaic verbiage as well as detail beyond all reason.  I found them charming, but I would never read any more of them.  They are an acquired taste.  If you don't love old English novels, don't bother.  If you like Doyle & Christie, you'll probably find them interesting.  For the price, they are a bargain."
837,1,So not for me to read. I am up for any good HOTT read but this one turned my stomach. If your into it fine but this was not for me at all!
838,4,Some of the book was a little much storyline wise. It's definitely a steamy read which was its main appeal. I prefer steamy and believable and some was just too mushy for me but overall good quick read.
839,5,"I like to be able to rechanrge my Kindle in several places, and now I can do this this. Upstairs, downstairs and in the car!!"
840,4,"I wish I could give half stars. If so, I would give this 3 1/2 stars, but I can't so I will be nice and give it 4. It's not a bad book for the price (I got mine for $0.99). I will say that the editing was simply atrocious, but if you can get around that, it is a quick read. The characters are likeable and the story moves along pretty quickly. However, there were a few parts that I felt were too contrived and not overly believable to actually happen in real life. BUT, the love scenes were HOT and steamy, very well done. I finished this in a day, so go ahead and read this if you are a fan of the author (which I am) and are interested in escaping reality for a few hours."
841,5,As I started reading this book I thought I was getting into an adolescent level series (see comments on the other books in this series). It was well written and only a few mistakes in digitizing that did not distract from the story line.
842,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It was well written, and if you like medical stories, this is good one. Wished it went further into thier life after falling in love again.  Good book though.  Easy reAding"
843,1,Author seem to have rushed through the paranormal story to focus on the romance between the two main characters. Then abruptly ends the story as if she rolled over from all the great sex and went to sleep.
844,1,"I didn't even finish this. My idea of a good read is not reading about someone getting gangbanged. I didn't think this book would be that way. I really thought it would have been a little more in depth, with more story and not just pure erotica. But, that's just my opinion. Check it out if you're into that kind of thing."
845,4,An mysterious tale of adventure and vengeance.  It was a bit wordy regarding studies of the naturalist with terms I am not familiar with but enjoyable all the same.  This is a classic I had missed up until now but am glad I read it. It was easy to get through.
846,4,"The Belkin case is made of nice, soft neoprene.  It sports dual zippers that slide freely up two sides, forming a pocket to slide the Kindle into.  The area you see online with the faux leather has extra padding.  If you put the Kindle in ""head first,"" that extra padding fits right over the screen.The Belkin cover does not completely open up and it does not attach to the Kindle.  Consequently, the Kindle must be removed for reading, which may be inconvenient for some people.  I actually prefer it the way it is.I was a little worried that the Belkin cover did not have any hard shell protection, so I added themCover Polycarbonate Kindle Hard Shell Cover Case for 6-inch Amazon Kindle 2nd Generation with Hard Screen Protector.  With the Mcover on, the Kindle is still slim enough to  fit into the Belkin and I have dual protection for my Kindle.This is a great cover.  It slides easily into my purse and keeps my Kindle free of scratches and protects it from light knocks."
847,5,Book one is a good start to what will be a good series of surviving after the war. There are quite a few characters introduced and the storyline jumps from character to character but eventually it does become cohesive.
848,5,If u love romance novels this one will not disappoint!  I enjoyed this book immensely!  The author really knows her romance!  I loved the characters in this book!  I can't wait to read more by this author!
849,5,"There is no other way to describle a book by Tina Folsom except to say perfection. This is a great story with hot romance, action and a storyline that will keep you reading without taking a break to see how it ends!"
850,4,"This ""cheesy"" paranormal romance had me from the first line.  It is a quick novella, but I just couldn't put it down.  The title is what captured me originally, but the fun didn't stop there.  Poor Lucy is a medium that has a lot of pent up sexual frustration, and until that gets resolved she will be visited by extremely horny ghosts.  Lucy's boss, Karma (isn't that adorable!) has called to let Lucy know that in order for these ghosts to go away, Lucy will need to be sexually satisfied.  Lo-and-behold, in comes PI Jake Cox!  He is quite the hunk and just what Lucy needs to get her fix.I loved the writing style in this novella, Andrews has a way with words that just made the entire story flow quickly and smoothly.  This is book one in the Karmic Consultant series, and I will definitely be checking out the rest of the books in the series.Posted on my blog: &lt;A HREF=""[...]> A Writer's Review &lt;/a>"
851,3,A quick little story which tells us about the time Kaylee spends in the physch ward mentioned in the first book. I think if I'd read this first I might have been a little confused. But I was curious as to what happened her and how she felt in there. Plus knowing what you know after reading the first book you really think how could her Aunt & especially her Uncle have put her in that situation in the first place when they knew exactly what was happening. If I was her I would have been PPIIIISSSSSEEEDDDD when I found out!
852,3,"Not what i expected. yet a very interesting book. i usually don&#8216;t read books from this era, just goes to show they can be of interest."
853,2,"I did the math, and for all four books it will cost almost $8!!!  What?!?  These stories are just way too short for $8!  You can get 2 full length novels for that amount!! (shaking my head) I like to finish books even if they suck, but I refuse to pay that much.  My frugal heart just won't let me.  Not only that, but they aren't knock your socks off hot.  Sigh..."
854,5,"I met Dan and Elle in Dirty, Megan Hart's first Harlequin Spice release. I loved that book.I won't rehash the storyline because the blurb does that amazingly well. What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again. I know they've got their happily-ever-after and that alone can sustain me, but I like Elle and her complexity. She's real. Megan Hart has quickly become on of my favorite authors."
855,3,"I enjoyed this story, but the hero, Cal, was so very serious! I want to read the book about the younger, more easy-going brother Roy!  Secondary character, Ned, lent a lot to this book also. Busy story - there were times when it seemed like ""What else can happen??"""
856,5,This was a well rounded well thought out story. Great imagination Evangeline! Thank you for sharing your kinky fantasies with us all. Keep up the great work.
857,5,"I really enjoyed this book. I bought the sequel and am looking forward to reading it.HOWEVER, if the author reads these reviews -- please! It's = it is and Its = belongs to it. I know this is really picky of me but I was a typesetter / proofreader / editor for many years, and not only do I find it horribly distracting to see it wrong, but it also perpetuates the error in the minds of people who honestly don't know the difference."
858,4,of course we were told how short part 1 was.... and it was hot and sensual.... Im gonna  read and happily pay for part 2
859,5,"Two people meet, are attracted to each other, and fall in love. No b--chy ex girlfriends..no trouble making ex boyfriend.... I would recommend purchasing....HOT"
860,2,"I should have know by the cover it was a bit out of my taste for books.  It started out good, but i got bored before i finished.mary"
861,4,"I have always loved Edgar Allan Poe. It is great to have this as part of my Kindle collection. Often when I am writing something, I am inspired by reading &#34;The Raven&#34; and other works by Edgar Allen Poe. And to have this book right at my fingertips is great."
862,4,"This book could use some 'tightening up' related to story-telling and plot development.  Even still, I found the story and the characters to be 'real' enough that I was able to enjoy the book overall."
863,4,I actually was surprised to find how much of the story took place in North Carolina. It was like hearingnews from a local friend. So intrigued by the descriptions. Enjoyed the book very much
864,5,"I was hooked right from the beginning. I love the way these two men met. It was so funny and instantly made me love them both. They had seemingly clashing personalities despite a deep mutual attraction.I loved the character Edward. He was emotional, very loving, and had a lot of personality - flamboyant, yet not effeminate. Okay, he was a bit of a brat, but he made up for it in other areas. I love that he and Winston (the bulldog) wore matching bandanas. So funny. And the fringe. Oh man, the fringe.And Jack was very likable, too. He was temperamental and demanding, but at the same time, very goodhearted. His anger was understandable once we learn more about his lifestyle.I read another review that said these two had no chemistry. Are you kidding me? These guys were so H.O.T. together! Edward secretly wanting to be manhandled by a big, tough, cowboy - and Jack, wanting to just grab Edward and make him his. UNF. When they finally get together it was the perfect combination of hot and sweet. These boys are going to make each other so happy. I would love to hear more about their future escapades.One more comment - this book is perfectly titled. When that particular phrase was used in the story, it was so touching.Loved this one."
865,2,"I've picked this up a few times,  but it never manages to hold my attention. There is no tension,  nothing really to explore or find out.  It's too sweet and mawkish.  I've never finished it and this is my 3rd attempt,  so it gets 2 stars from me."
866,5,"(I posted this review under the ""Free Kindle Books and Tips"" ap  instead of ""for Kindle"".  I use this on my Kindle Touch and should have posted this here.)I received my Kindle Touch for Christmas 2011 and found this blog shortly after. I was floundering as I was looking through the thousands of free books that Amazon has listed. I found it tiresome and difficult to search Amazon looking for books that I really was interested in reading. I spent WAY too much time browsing through all the book offers and still wasn't finding exactly what I'd hoped (without a lot of effort.)I found this blog during my search for ""free"" and tried it out. Two week free trial and it costs just change each month to keep it going. The convenience to me is worth it. I love this blog and it's exactly the right fit for me. I don't select every book, but I find more than enough to keep me and my kids (over)stocked with books without spending hours searching for them. Indie authors and mainstream authors...I've found both via the blog.I get a blog entry (delivered directly to my Kindle) just about every day and sometimes a few entries each day (not sure if he guarantees updates on the weekends, but there are weekend entries anyway!) Every day there are 5 or more books listed from various categories/genres. He includes the overall Amazon rating from reviews and the description from Amazon and links to ""purchase"" the free book. Always make sure the book is still free. They're free when he writes about them, but if you don't check the blog until the next day, the free offering may be gone. That's controlled by Amazon/publisher/author, not the blog.He sometimes includes info if he's read the book or wrote a review for it. I find it amazing that he's able to come up with such a range of books and have so many of them appeal to me. (But not all,thank goodness...what would I do with 5+ new books every day?!)He also includes other Amazon and Kindle tips periodically. If you read the blog long enough, you will see some of the tips repeated, but that's not bad. I've read some and had no interest, and then later, the same tip meant something to me. He also periodically includes links to LOTS of the free books, by category. If you've spent time searching for free books, you know that it's not as easy as just clicking category buttons. He shares his links that he's developed.I've read a few of the reviews that say his blog is too heavy with (insert genre name here) and I can only think they haven't give the blog enough of a chance. I see books offered from most categories at some point. The funny thing is, I'm pretty sure he mentioned that he's not a sci-fi fan, but I've ended up liking a lot of his selections...he has a good method of deciding which books to include in the blog, I guess.I also really like that he periodically asks his audience for input. He wants to know what I want to read! I also feel like I *know* this blog author now. His blogs aren't full of personal info, but again, if you read it long enough, you get an opportunity to be entertained and informed by his great style of writing.This blog has really led me down the road to Kindle addiction. I think that's a good thing...although I spend a lot more time hiding from my kids in the bathroom so I can just finish one more book..."
867,4,This was an interesting turn to the classic vampire story.  I liked that the vampire was a good guy and that he proved to be better than the humans who had trained the hunter.  Good read.  Two thumbs up.
868,5,"This was such a great read! I was intrigued by the excerpt provided on the product page and because it was free I thought I'd give it a try - and I was hooked.The story is based on the theory that a sample of Jesus Christ's DNA has not only survived, but has also been confirmed. A secret society known as the Vinces recruits the necessary scientists and a naive young newlywed couple to be surrogates.  In a seemingly ""side story"" there is a meteor racing towards earth threatening to bring the extinction of he human race. The twists and turns each of these story lines take independent of the other is fantastic, but when they begin to meld together it is non-stop action!This writer is solid and knows how to weave a web that will suck you in from start to finish.  The story line may seem far fetched and have the potential to be religious drivel or sappy romance - but its not! I would classify this as a true thriller/action-adventure/suspense masterpiece. Considering this was a freebie on Amazon, upon finishing the first book I purchased the rest of the series and started #2 the same day."
869,3,"As a baby-boomer, I was really looking forward to this book.  And, as a baby-boomer, it brought back some fine memories - and a look at my own regrets and ""should haves"" and ""what ifs.""David Grossman is successful in the publishing world, except he's not happy.  Then he makes contact with Jill Black, a woman from his past - a past that's 40 years old. The ""what ifs"" start to germinate and their email relationship starts to take hold. Their entire relationship is based on Woodstock and what could have been.I found Jill to be a nauseating ""me, me, me"" woman who I couldn't like at all.  Grossman ... well, I wanted to shake him! DO something, SAY something, MAKE a decision! And I think that's why I didn't enjoy the book as well as other readers did.The story is well told and the author most certainly can write.  The book resonates because we all look back and wonder ""what if"" and the 60s references are a delight to those of us who lived through that time.  But my less than stellar response is based on the characters.  I just couldn't like them even though I wanted to."
870,4,"Ok, I got this book for free on my Kindle, and although it was short, it was quite well written.This isn't my typical genre, but I liked the characters and the way they were developed.  This writer has talent, if she should choose to branch out.Good summer read."
871,5,Stephanie Bond is an excellent author for those of us that enjoy Romantic Comedy!  I have added her to my  list of favorite authors.  Her books are delightfully humorous and I hope she continues to tickle our funny bones for years to come.
872,5,"Fabulous story. Sweet and incredibly hot!(Would have liked more of the beginning of the relationship, but maybe that's just the voyeur in me)"
873,4,"Alexia Colton had spent every summer since she was fourteen visiting her grandmother in the charming seaside town of Jaffrey's Cove, until adulthood and the need to work kept her away. She loves the ocean, and always felt a sense of peace and home there, and was always enchanted by the dolphins that often play in the surf just off the shore. When her grandmother, a once strong and vibrant woman, now feeble and needing help to move into an assisted living facility, calls Alexia sounding frantic, Alexia rushes to her gram's side to get her settled. Sharing this time with her grandmother, whom Alexia can tell is starting to decline in health and mental acuity, is invaluable to her, and when Victoria offers her granddaughter her seaside home and a stunning family heirloom, Alexia takes the necklace but declines on the house. Her work is in the middle of the country, after all.Soon Alexia is having erotic dreams of the boy, now a man, she'd once met as a child, making love to her in a cavern she's dreamed of her entire life. And her gram is acting stranger and stranger...and significantly less feeble than she'd been when Alexia first arrived. The ocean is calling to her and her body is burning with unfamiliar hungers. Alexia's world is shifting and she'll soon realize that she's not as human as she'd always thought, mermen are real, and the dolphins she's loved her whole life are all citizens of Jaffrey's Cove. And Alexia herself is the new matriarch of their pod, with two gorgeous and dedicated consorts, the cousins Joshua and Anthony, to love her body, heart, and mind for as long as she chooses. What's not to love about life changes like that??I don't need to spend much time on the erotica aspects of Tidal Wave. The sex is sizzling hot and extremely well done. Arend manages a nice blend of emotion driven sexuality and explicit sex that's extremely satisfying and too rare in erotica romance. I also have to give her credit for how deftly she managed to keep the sex scenes (of which there are several...it's erotica, after all) from completely overshadowing or eclipsing the plot and character development. That's rather a nifty accomplishment in a novella length story, which tends to suffer in those areas to begin with. Also, I'm very very picky about my reading choices when it comes to menage a trois erotica, when I read it at all. It's not a particular favorite of mine and I rarely find menage done in a way that appeals to my tastes. Tidal Wave mastered that for me. I was exceptionally pleased with all sexual aspects of the story.The other parts had a few bumps of a less erotic kind. This isn't the first story or series I've read by Vivian Arend. I've read several of the Granite Lake Wolves, as well, so this wasn't too much of a surprise because I've had this issue with her as an author before. Arend tends to master the sex and the emotion of a story in very short order, but the plot and characterizations sometimes have issues, as Tidal Wave does. Some of that is the nature of the beast in a novella. I like the way Arend writes and I'm greedy, so I want there to be more meat to the story, but to have more meat you have to either sacrifice some of the sex or write a book. While I have high hopes that Arend will eventually write a full length novel, with her novellas, she has a tendency to skimp a bit on fully developing the mythos of the world she's built in each story. In Tidal Wave that was a particular shame, because I would've loved learning more about the merpeople and spent more time with them in their dolphin form. I found the concept behind the plot to be fresh and unique and that's so rare it should be fully explored.There were a couple of plot holes and characterization blips that got ignored in this story. Why was Joshua sent away every summer Alexia returned to Jaffrey's Cove after the first time they met and shared a sweet kiss when she was fourteen? He wondered but there was never an answer given. Why was he treated so dismissively by his brothers? Why did Alexia dream of the cavern before ever going there and before receiving the medallion? No one ever had before. Those holes were frustrating.There was no explanation for Joshua's sudden calm acceptance of his cousin vying for Alexia's affections when earlier in the story he was quite adamant about being her only. The quick turn around in Anthony's case, from him telling Joshua he wasn't really interested in answering Alexia's call to being all gung ho about consorting with her was addressed, but in a cursory way at best that felt unsatisfying. Michael's plot thread was a very nice conflict and it added some depth to the story, but it wasn't as fleshed out as I would've liked, lacked a real solid motivation given the defined mythos of the pod, and the resolution was lackluster. Victoria was a nice secondary character, but she wasn't used as much as she could've been and she sort of left her granddaughter with very little understanding of her people. You'd think the former matriarch would care a little more than just passing off a necklace before disappearing.I know it sounds like I'm being picky, but it's frustrating to find that great blend of erotic sexuality and original mythos with an intriguing plot and totally likable characters...then have a bunch of little issues through the story. None of that made me dislike Tidal Wave by any means. I hope I don't give that impression. I enjoyed the story...it's just I wish there had been a bit more. I know; I'm greedy. 3.5 Stars."
874,4,"I've been wanting to check out Repairmanjack for awhile so when I saw this short story, I quickly grabbed it. It was a fun read and verified that I should check out some of the longer stories."
875,3,Cute book. Quick read. reads more like a kids book but I wouldn't say it is for kids with the language and off color jokes. No meat to the story.. but cute eough
876,4,"Sex in a club's cleaning closet, extremely hot!Then some more hot sex on a kitchen counter.I would recommend for someone who wants to read a steamy romance."
877,3,"MACKENZIE'S MAGIC by Linda Howard.STORY BRIEF:Maris is a horse trainer.  Someone plans to harm her favorite horse, and Maris is hit in the head.  She wakes up in a motel room the next day with a concussion.  Mac is with her.  He was recently hired to work with her on the horse farm.  Together they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about it.  Maris has no memory of what she was doing before she was injured.  Maris realizes she is attracted to Mac.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was about half the length of a typical romance novel.  It was a ""falling in lust"" story.  There was no time for any relationship development.  It was shallow.  I wanted more intrique, unique characters, and more interesting plot and dialogue.  But if you loved the series, you might like this out of curiosity.After the mystery and danger is over, a chunk of time is spent with Maris' family in Wyoming.  There is the cute little toddler, all the hunky men, their wives and children.  Everyone is loving and protective.  It was a pleasant time.OTHER BOOKS:There are five Mackenzie books.  The first three were much better than books 4 and 5.  This is book 4.  For a list of my reviews of all five books, see my 5 star review of Burn posted 7-11-09.CAUTION SPOILER:I didn't understand the scene in which Maris was hit in the head (which was told and not shown).  Apparently the bad guy was starting to inject the horse when Maris arrived.  He hits her in the head causing a concussion, but she is able to get on the horse and ride away.  Can one be concussed and still mount and ride?  Why couldn't the bad guy finish the injection as she was mounting?  I wanted more details and showing, not telling.DATA:Kindle count story length: 1462.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 1, about a page long.  Setting: current day mostly Kentucky and Wyoming.  Copyright: 1996.  Genre: contemporary romance."
878,2,I really like James' books. I think I've read them all. This just wasn't as interesting. It felt flat without as much characterization.
879,5,"This is a book all about the body's pH level and how much it impacts our lives on a daily basis. This book will introduce you to understanding your body's pH level and open your eyes to how your pH level can adjust your feeling of wellness and how it allows certain illnesses to be accepted into your body.This is a book everyone should read, and it's fairly short so it shouldn't take any person more than a few days to complete. It's great if you are interested in learning about alternative health care. I know I am always interested in what I can do to better myself and my body with what I have at home, and away from a doctor. But, neither the book or I am suggesting that this is a book to use as alternative health care for serious problems. This book is best used to help small ailments and leave the big stuff to the doctors who get paid the big bucks.There are so many different factors that change how we feel every day, and this book will help you see what this means, and how to keep negative energy out and stay positive and healthy. Overall I would give this book a 5/5. It contains an abundance amount of information in a short amount of pages, all in which I found very helpful.[...]"
880,2,The title confuses me. I hate when an author writes a book with a part 2 in mind. Honestly I won't buy part 2 cuz this book was just ok. The whole book is about Mercedes being a hoe so I don't see whether the just let comes in.
881,4,"After reading &#34;Little Fuzzy&#34; in one of your SF Megapacks, I purchased this collection and am about 2/3 thru it.Really fun SF, with enough techno consistancy to bind the stories into what becomes a familiar background.Mix in a murder mystery and some space opera and you have a well rounded and very enjoyable collection."
882,4,"To view full review including excerpt and dialogue highlight, please visit BonaFide Reflections.bona-fide-reflections (dot) comI completed this review as a guest post. You can also view my blog atreadersedyn (dot) blogspot (dot) comReview:I read Tyger, Tyger Burning Bryght as few months ago and am only just getting a chance to write the review. As I recall, this was the first sci-fi, paranormal romance I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Ms. Cade does a fantastic job of creating a believable, futuristic world of alien species and technologies dreamed of. While there is a lot of language used, somehow it fit. I suppose I can attribute such raw acceptance to the fact that this is a science fiction novel. Within my mind, as far as science fiction goes, anything goes. You just have to be open-minded enough to be able to both accept it and recreate it in your head. But I am no strange to the realm of science fiction. In books yes, but not with television. My Dad raised me on Star Trek, so from a very young age I was exposed to all types of creatures. It is kind of funny to watch the original Star Trek series now when you see how far we have come with special effects. As I got older I watched shows like Stargate: SG1, Farscape, all of the Start Trek spin-offs, and many more. But I digress. I believe my point it that such an exposure has allowed me to broaden my mind when reading outside of the box.Maybe I should get back to the book now. *coughs* Ahem. So Tryon is a Tyger and has been caught off world and mid voyage in the middle of his mating shift. Needless to say, he needs sex and lots of it - fast. The consequences could mean the deaths of many crew members should he be unable to satisfy the sexual need deep within. Calla is also a Tyger and took notice of Tryon when the voyage began, but when he looked right past her, her hope for a tryst faded and he instead became the object of her fantasies. Now she is the only hope for the crew and, well ... Tryon's only hope to regain control and ability to perform his duties.I can honestly say that I really enjoyed the time spent reading this story. It was the first time I have read Ms. Cade and I will definitely be back to read more of her work. Perhaps even within this series, The Orion Series. From what I found on the publisher's website, Tyger Tyger is the first book in the series with 5 books currently published. I wanted to share some other excerpts with everyone, but I am guest posting and thought I should try to keep it clean. I don't mind saying that I had one heck of a time finding passages that were ""clean"". This story is loaded with graphic sexual encounters, and dang! Let me tell you just how smokin' hot they are! Good lawd!That said, even with all of the sexually descriptive scenes, Ms. Cade manages to craft a workable storyline between them. I liked that Tryon is an alpha male that is unexpectedly paired with a strong female. Calla gives as good as she gets most of the time and inevitably, this dense alpha finally gets the clue that he likes it. Unaccustomed to females giving him attitude, Calla well and truly rocks his world. And in the midst of all of this is another component to the story. A group of terrorists has snuck on board and plans to sabotage the ship. The intruder is eventually left to Tryon to sift out. Meanwhile, Tryon makes a muck of his relationship with Calla. Seems crazy, right? A shifting male Tyger, his unplanned female mate with sass, a saboteur on board, the fate of many depending upon it all, crazy amounts of hawt sex, and a potential future relationship gone awry by the ever-present male without a clue. Yeah, I know. But it works and I was completely entertained by it. I mean if a shifting male Tyger and loads of awesomesauce sex don't grab you, then I really have no idea what else I could dangle in front of you. It is not a deep story that is going to explore the inner angst of the main characters, but it is entertaining at the very least.(Digital book purchased for personal library)"
883,4,"Wow dragons!! Knights!! and Mistress' oh my. smiles I loved it!! A great blend of characters and story line. I just had fun reading this. A bit sassy girl meets a dragon and a Knight and in one day is swept off her feet. I loved the action it was fast paced. The sex was hot, the element that the pleasure of the riders and the best are intertwined. Wait did I mention the sex scenes were hot!! smiles again. A awesome tale that made you want to continue to read and a wee bit sad when you were done. Garath and Lars played the story of mellowing bel very well. Makes one think who played who. Did I mention dragon sex?? along with magic. The Mama dragon is soo endearing you cant help but love her. Its a good thing she has more books in this series. Enjoy"
884,4,"This book deals with selfishness, immaturity, greed, and insecurities.  It seems typical of Rebecca Forster's books. I tried a sample of her work and the lead character seems to always be an insecure, beautiful, large woman who can't seem to stay focused on the job at hand. I enjoyed the plot. I kept wondering if she would ever grow up, use some wisdom, and finish the job. Toward the middle of the book, I started skipping the introspective dialog to get back to the storyline. It's kind of slow but the storyline holds your attention."
885,5,"Published in 2004, when Real Estate was booming, this book brought back memories for me.  The descriptions of the area are good and the story has humor along with the murders.  Good capture of the greed that results from inflated prices and supply and demand ! ! !"
886,5,"Only regrets I have far that I did not have access to all of these books as a child, and that the original illustrations weren't included.  I feel sorry for those who only saw the movie and never read the original Oz books!  This collection alone makes the cost of of my kindle worth the expense."
887,5,"I'm too old and it's too much time I'm around. Or maybe it's only that I read too much. Z.A. Maxfiled wrote a parody about a man who wrote a parody... I think I'm able to recognize to whom Z.A. Maxfield identifies herself in the novel, enough to say it's not the writer (too simple), and I recognized who was the writer she is paying homage to.The story is actually a comedy of errors: Jae is a literary critic working for an LGBT Magazine, The Adversary (quite clear reference to The Advocate...); Jae is an half Caucasian half Asian man, and his full name is Jae-sun, but he goes for Jae, and this sometime leads people to think that he is a female. Often writers who are pissed off from one of his reviews accuse him to be a woman, and so to being unable to understand a real good piece of Gay Literature. You would think that Jae would be the first to defend himself claiming that he is a man, and instead he has always let it go, finding useful to have the change to play the double role, male or female when it is necessary. Like in this case: Jae is real angry since a woman, Kelly Kendall, dared to write a parody of one of Jae's favourite coming of age novel, Doorways. Doorways was like The Sorrows of Young Werther or some other breaking coming of age novel for Jae, and seeing a trashy novel like Windows taking and ridiculing it, it's too much. Above all since the author who did it is a woman! (payback is hard to digest...) How does she dare? She can't understand how important that book was for young Jae.Problem is that Kelly can truly understand, since he is not a ""she"", he is Kelly Mackay, alias Kelly Kendall, alias Kieran Anders, the author of both Doorways than Windows. He wrote Windows to fulfil a bet with Will, his houseboy / dogs boy, a 20 years old former hustler who he welcomed in his home as secretary and buddy friend with benefits. Where Kelly was probably the angst teenager in Doorways, Will is probably the slut teenager in Windows... they are two different perspective on the same story, and Kelly is also probably overgrown on the teenager he was. At this point I also recognized another gentle homage Z.A. Maxfield probably did, to the movie Finding Forrester; not only Kelly Kendall has the same Irish/Scottish origin of the character in the movie, William Forrester, but he has also the same problem to being trapped by his first novel: people adore Doorways so much, that Kelly is scared to writing something else. To do so, he changed completely the genre and went under another pseudo. Plus Kelly suffers of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and he avoids like a plague everything that is not ordinary or stranger.Jae is bent on ""outing"" Kelly Kendall as not only a woman (his publisher maintains the mystery around him) but also a plagiarist. He starts to pestering Kelly with emails from a supposedly female fan, StrawberryFields, mails to which Kelly replies with gentleness but avoiding giving details. Only that, email after email, both Jae than Kelly start to realize that they have much in common, and that they like to talk with the other online... is it possible that a so good online relationship turns in something real? Yes, it's, since Jae is used to have things to easily, and dating Kelly it's not easy at all. Someone could say that Kelly is a nut case, but I think that he is only a very special man, and he needs someone to take care of him. Don't get me wrong, Kelly is not retarded or similar, he is only a man with a lot of odd customs, but it's what makes him a special man, and he has not to change; he only has to find a man who can deal with him. And learning to deal with Kelly maybe will teach to Jae to see things less in Black and White, to see the shades, to be more flexible, and learning that, to be a better man. Not always being a crusader is a good thing, sometime crusade did a very poor job to humanity.When I said that being a crusader is not necessarily a good thing, I'm not only referring to Jae's fight to ""out"" everyone who hides his homosexuality (which negative side we read in the fate of an actor at the beginning of the book); take Kelly's OCD... someone like Jae, so strong and used to see only the right and the wrong, probably would try to cure himself, to force nature to submit to human's will... and doing so you would destroy the real Kelly. The real Kelly it's not the ""healthy"" man, the real Kelly is the obsessed one, the troubling one, he is special since he is not normal, level him to the rest of the world, means to kill him.I like also as the author dealt with Kelly and Will's relationship; true, they are having a sexual relationship, but not from Kelly's side or Will's one there is a real emotional commitment. Both of them know that what is between them it's not real love, problem is that Kelly doesn't know if real love exist, at least not until Jae. I like that, even if at the beginning the author let us in the more intimate details between Kelly and Will, when Jae is becoming something more than an email address for Kelly, that relationship slowly but steadily turns in a real friendship, without benefits. It's made in a way that I don't feel bad for Will, on the contrary, I believe that he needs more Kelly as a friend rather than as a lover. Not only Kelly finds his love, but it happens at the same time when Will's past is revealed (a past of child molestation), and in a strange play of destiny, it's actually a better thing for him that Kelly, who can be a fatherly figure for Will due to the age difference, becomes totally sexually detached."
888,5,"The absolute best part, for me, in Reality Creation:101 is the following passage:Rule number one: ""The best advice given is advice asked for.""Rule number two: ""If you want to lead, lead by example.""Your only job is to work on you and unplug yourself from the belief in limitation.Pinckley hits points that are relevant to being successful from our inner drive that we all have, as opposed to outside influences. He tells readers how to access that inner drive and put it to work. I've just started reading it a second time, this time I'm taking notes. Reality Creation:101 is a must read for anyone who wants to improve their overall position in life."

891,4,I liked the idea of this bookit was relatively a quick read and pretty much you figure out what was going to happen.It was a sweet story of finding each other again and I was glad that I read it.  If your looking for a true romance this book is for you
892,4,Fast paced paranormal that blends easily.  Twins that work together from 2 opposite sides.  Lots of wonderful men that love or lust after Raven / Winter.  It's addicting...looking forward to see how this plays out.

We have a very confused individual who is special and is becoming involved in momentous events.  The story flowed and never slowed down.  Would like to have seen the volume be a bit longer.  And it looks like the editing has been redone as I did not see those errors.Now, if one expects a bit more than fantasy reading, then there are a few nits/pics about this story and character that are mentioned in other reviews.  Since I am not looking for 'deeper meaning' in my SCI FI reading, I liked it and look forward to the other two episodes."
894,4,"I was new to this author and was curious about the story line so ordered it. I was not disappointed with the read, it was catching and fluid which kept me wanting to read it to find out how the hero and protagonist were going to combat each other. I had to get used to the idea of demons though, I did and actually enjoyed the read."
895,4,"I enjoyed this spin on Cinderella's story. The drag queen fairy godmother was a hoot! I really enjoyed this book. It is a plot that endures my heart. I know I want to meet a rich man, have great sex and fall in love. I would recommend this hot and entertaining read."
896,4,I'm not really sure where it actually fits into the overall story line.This story involves only Chewie and his wife and son.  The other characters are only mentioned in passing.  It was enjoyable and well written but I was glad it was very short and didn't keep me from the main story for very long.
897,5,"This book started out with one interesting plot, thenout of nowhere , it takes a sharp left into anotherstory even Juicier !"
898,4,"After reading Mr. Simon's first book (For Sale in Palm Springs"" I read ""Springtime in Sonora.""  I was definitely liking Henry Wright and the other characters more and more.  I was glad to see that Mr. Wright was continuing to move on in his life.  Even though there was just as much minutia in this story, the writing seemed a bit more interesting than the first book.  I would recommend trying Albert Simon's mysteries."
899,5,"""Redeemer"" is like no other novel I have read, and one of my all time favorites. It is unique and unpredictable, as are all of this author's stories, and you will find yourself thinking about it at unexpected moments. The movement of the story is constant, in the best way, and the characters fully visible. There is a delusional, truly threatening villain, a devoted mother and her two-year-old daughter, and a handsome, enigmatic hero, whose assignment to keep mother and daughter safe, becomes very personal. There is a history interwoven in the form of a story-within-a-story, which itself is fascinating, but which also holds crucial elements of the main story. There is a smartness and passion, like in all of Killough-Walden's work, that keeps the story with you long after you finish reading, in the very best way."
900,5,I like it because it gives a more accurate translation of certain words than the King James.  I would recommend it.
901,4,"These stories were described as ""pulp"", and I would never have guessed that I'd enjoy them, but I did!  Immensely!  All 4 stories in this collection take place in the mid-1920's and have a definite 'feel' to them that is characteristic of the era.  Most of the mysteries set in this time period in Britain tend to focus more on the lives of the (usually upper-class) characters and only secondarily on the mystery.  These books put the mystery front and center, and while Drummond is definitely upper-class in terms of being comfortably off financially and without a need for 'gainful' employment, he's not nobility and he doesn't hobnob with the landed gentry.  In our day and age, he'd be considered middle-class, and this gives the stories a sense of familiarity.There's a great deal of action, and violence - but it's fistfight and rough-and-tumble violence, not blood and guts like so many modern tales.  It's the violence of a refined, genteel world that still remembers the eye-opening shock of WWI as a salutatory lesson in man's inhumanity to man.IMO, the first 3 stories were much stronger and more likeable than the 4th, which is told in a different 'tone' and 'voice, but the tales themselves are very well done and interesting.  There's a common thread running between all 4 stories in this book, so they lead one to another.  All were excellent examples of the writer's art from the time period, and still have considerable appeal today.  Highly recommended!  There is also a volume 2  with 3 or 4 more books collected to show the further adventures of Bulldog (who I must say is an extremely likeable character!).Note on Kindle formatting:  Very good.  I couldn't find any issues with the first 3 books in this collection.  The 4th wasn't anywhere near as good - there were many OCR errors, which did slow down reading somewhat, though not to the point where the book was difficult to read."
902,4,"I got this book free for my Kindle & I'm glad to have done so.  It is a very original story with a good plot, subplot & a nice surprise.I highly recommend it."
903,3,"A very short read, which is disappointing because it was really interesting and made me want to know more. I wanted to know more about Dardanus and his back story, and of course, I wanted to know what happened the next day. Even if the author hadn't made this a full-length novel, it could have been a longer novella; there is so much potential.While I was somewhat turned off by the demand/need of submission thing, I did enjoy the intrigue and the set-up, as well as the surprise of Dardanus's change of heart.Not a bad read for free on Kindle!"
904,5,"WAY different from how I imagined the story line. I have to say, it was a great read. I recommend this classic by Jules Verne. Know what I mean?"
905,3,This story was very entertaining.  I liked when her brother Max challenged Erik because he hurt his sister.  But truthfully Erik should have known that Annie was the one he was engaged to because of her hair color and the hotel she was staying at don't you think.
906,4,"I actually really liked this one.  I've way overspent my book buying budget since getting a kindle so had to focus on free down loads recently and frankly,  even for free most are too expensive - they are a waste of time!  So I was really pleased with this. There is erotic tension and angst between Jenesta and her husband, Roarke.  She's not quite clear why he married her,  but she loves him,  and he's gorgeous but so gentle in bed.  He has dreams and desires he dares not bring to her... until she stumbles into his secret chamber,  and all is revealed.Actually the entire piece is basically a set up to the chamber scene,  the chamber scene,  which is entirely sexual and not hard core bdsm,  more light spanking and bondage,  and then ramifications of the chamber scene.  For a freebee it's excellent.  I see now that it's back to being $2.  For $2 it's not bad... more an extended magazine piece than a novella,  it really is very short,  1201 location points (so hard for me to really understand them,  but I'm starting... 2 - 3 000 is a longer novella,  4 - 5000 is a full length book)  so this very short,  more a nibble than a bite.  But it's tasty and well written,  and I'll probably even reread it some time... so worth the time,  and you have to decide for yourself if that's worth the money."
907,5,"Good read, just enough werewolf. Good story line. Would recommend if you like the vampires werewolf type books. Will look for more by Walters."
908,4,"I really like this story and I'm already checking out the next one in this series.  I got this book as a &#34;Freebie&#34; and just as soon as I get some money I will be buying the next one in the series.Yes, this story line has  M/M and M/F/M love scenes but the list says that the two men are lovers so someone should NOT be upset about it.Like one reviewer said this would be a 5+ star story with a bit of rewrite but I did enjoy it just as it is.  If you like this kind of story line I believe you will enjoy this book.  Of course this is JMHO!"
909,4,"Moxie Mezcal, &lt;strong>Sweet Dream, Silver Screen&lt;/strong> (Moxie Mezcal Publishing, 2009)Moxie Mezcal. Two drinks that, mixed, would probably combine to form the worst taste you've ever had in your mouth. Thankfully, you don't have to drink it to want to read it. Tough, literate (if amateur at times), fun slice of neo-noir reminiscent more than once of what might have happened had Kathy Acker decided to try and write Raymond Chandler.  I should probably take points off for the meta, but I'd just end up adding them back on for the wit and honesty: ""I was behind the wheel while he thumbed through the dog-eared paperback I had been lugging around in my backpack. It was a cheap murder mystery called &lt;em>Invisible Ink&lt;/em> that tried to ape the old hard-boiled detective stories of Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler with mixed results."" Indeed. I've read a number of complaints with the ending; I didn't see it. I'm wondering if folks didn't get it (while Mezcal drops enough hints to what's going on, she doesn't point them out--and I'm factoring in that I could be totally misreading it myself) or whether it's just too ambiguous for the average reader, but I didn't have such problems. Good stuff from a solid new voice in thrillers. Check it out. ****"
910,4,This was a cute story for those who like romantic science fiction.  Interesting plot and ending with the right amount of suspense.
911,4,This was a nice story I truly enjoyed reading but a little disappointed in the conflict thought the other possibility of conflict would have been more interesting. Overall happy with the boom and will continue to read and recommend the author's work.
912,4,"This is a classic horror story.  Finley has turned thirteen, so he is safe from the murderer who snatches young boys in his town.  The descriptions of the miasma of fear and the &#34;narcotic like&#34; terror are so realistic, they leave a copper taste in my mouth."
913,4,"The story line is simple and it's nicely written.  It only took about an hour and a half for me to read it.  I wish they'd take that Blush tagline off of their products.  I don't choose a book for whether it has graphic scenes or not and for some reason, when I read that tagline, I always feel like the story is defective or a quick short story and not one of their better works.  This actually was one of Ellora's better stories.Possible spoilers from this point forward.Damien is a nice mage. He lives a good life as a Viscount and he's happily living in obscurity until he comes across a young lady of 15 years, walking to her death into the tide.  He rescues her, sends her off to a school for young ladies and then when she's 18 and beyond the legal reaches of her guardian, brings her home to live with him and his sister.  The only part of the story I didn't get was that there were a lot of rumors about the evil Baron, who raped Toria and how her father failed to notice these rumors or protect her from them and even made the Baron her legal guardian.  Even while trying to guard her reputation, it seems like the Viscount could have had enough information to have the Baron arrested for other reasons and safely jailed or executed or whatever.  But he manages to be a threat throughout the entire story and I think even if he had never been introduced into the story, he was definitely a villain in Toria's mind.There were some side characters that were interesting as well and it would be nice to see their stories as well.  Not deep literature, but definitely served it's purpose of entertainment and an escape from reality."
914,5,"The author picked a classic way for the bride to find out about her fiance' s infidelities.  Mollie's humiliated after overhearing her fiance's less-than-stellar thoughts of her while stuck in the rubber cake she hijacked from a stripper. Getting out of the cake is hard enough, seeing the dirt-bag fiance enjoying oral pleasures with a couple of strippers makes her furious, but realizing that her longtime crush is in attendance at the party to witness it all"
915,4,Well written and a good story.  The book works on several levels.  One is the mystery and the second is a widow working through her feelings about relationships and her feelings about starting over and her faith.It was easy to connect with the characters though I would have given it a five it Lew has been a little better developed.  I thought the other characters were more three dimensional.I would certainly welcome a third book in this series though given the publication dates of the two books and the authors lack of other books under this pen name I think the two may be all that are forthcoming.
916,4,Wow! That's about all I can say about Seducing Jane Porter. The whole power play between the submissive and the dominant was very well done. I tend to download free books and have realistic expectations. This book exceeded my expectations and I would read more by its author.
917,1,"SPOILERS IN THE REVIEWI actually think that reviewer Lasha described perfectly what I think about this book, but instead of just commenting on her review I decided to make it my own review because this book is a perfect example of why I think GFY trope could be so very offensive in my opinion. I think it can be beatifully and sensibly done too, just not in this book in my opinion. I was ready to scream more than once when I was reading it indeed and not just about who pitches and who catches. I was ready to scream when author made her characters say over and over AND OVER again how they do not want to do REALLY gay stuff, whatever that meant for them in any given moment. Or when one of the characters when they are getting ready to pose for the calendar and watch gay couple posing says that he is relieved that heavy duty gay action was over.Guess what you dolts? No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual. If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on, just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let's not forget the ""he has gay friends"" thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique, contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on. Yes, sex is hot, no book in my view is still horrible.And those are smart boys, yes? Studying to be pharmacist and another one is supposed to go to prestigious Ivy League business school? One would think their vocabulary would be a little bit more diversed."
918,4,"What I liked:* Layne and Dev, the leading pair, are well matched and balanced. I don't usually like when one half of the couple seems to be contributing to the relationship more than the other half but, although Laine looks like the typical damsel in distress, he's also loving and caring and he tries somewhat to get himself out of the trouble he's in.* Layne: he's too cute to be true, but I read about him with a big smile on my face all the time and sometimes I just want to feel good.* I couldn't put it down, it was fast, a light and fun read, a book I'd recommend as a pick-me-up.What I didn't like:* The fight scene didn't satisfy me. It seemed it was edited away, I don't know how to explain it. It felt too rushed, although it had the potential for something more exciting. Maybe it's because it's a short story, but I found the romance was ok, it lacked a bit of action (or angst, even if I admit I prefer the angst at a tolerable level and mine is pretty low).All in all my rating is 3.5 stars. The next book in the series is going to my TBR list."
919,5,"Well the final book of the series didn't disappoint. Although the laughter was less obvious, it was still present.Proving she needn't rely on just one element of her many skills.Thank you, Ms Bell, for bringing fun, back into an old lady's reading time. I will thank my daughter, too, for being willing to try new authors, and share the good ones with me. Enjoy this series as much as I did, and remain willing to read the new and unexpected. Bye Jonnie."
920,5,"I downloaded the sample (of course) on my Kindle, and had no idea what to expect from an author named ""Jonny Tangerine"". It hooked me from the very first Kindle page, and I bought it immediately. It is certainly worth 99 cents, and held my interest as well as if it had cost, say, $1.79.It is a very good, well written book and I advise you buy it. Of course, check out the free sample first. This is the type story and author I want to see more of in the Kindle Bookstore - action, a little mystery, and some suspense. I'm waiting for the next book in this series, or anything else written by ""Jonny Tangerine"". Can I see some ID on that name, buddy?"
921,1,"IT IS RAPE.So this heroine is seduced, tricked, coaxed and chemically disabled.  The author has a drug delivered trans dermally, via her mucous membrane, rather than by a drink. That's a different way of drugging, and her will was altered.  Even so she asks to be released.  AND IS REFUSED.  That's Rape.She did consent to come to a party, a sale of sex toys and she did come by herself to a BDSM venue.  So did she ""ask for it""?  She ""let them""  claims the perpetrator of the rape. BUT at the door she is directed to a different place, and locked in.  She is trying to leave when two men enter and offer her a massage.  She (foolishly? or naively ) agrees.  That's when the drug is administered.  Then she is chained in a dungeon.The ""Dom"" refuses to let her go.  He penetrates her with his fingers.  Her forces an orgasm.  He KNOWS that she has been drugged.  I stopped reading here.SO, I paid for a book where BDSM is promised, but what I got was a description of a rape.  NOT ACCEPTABLE.  And because I didn't read the book immediately, I can't return it.Most people fear having drugs put in their drinks and are wary of that.  This is a diabolical way of drugging a victim.  For any of us who have  experienced force used against their will, this book will be difficult to endure.Color me frustrated and disgusted."
922,5,"A Long Way From Disney is a great collection of short stories from Seth Harwood, the author of the action packed Jack Wakes Up. It includes a lot of touching coming of age stories set in the eighties. These are incredibly relatable and touching stories.I highly recommend this collection, which is priced far below the value of the stories contained within."
923,5,"I think this was a great way for me to try out a new author and find out if I like her writing style. It introduces characters that are used in other books and is a quick holiday read. Overall, I liked the story itself even if it was a bit short and hope to read more of Maggie's books.Very good."
924,5,"I've read a lot of books on manifestation and this one is definitely the best.The author offers up techniques and exercises that actually worked for me, andthat's all that really matters, right?I used the exercises in this book and INSTANTLY saw results. I felt more powerful,more in control, and had the energy and motivation to start making my dreams areality.This book gave me the big push I needed to actually get what I wanted in life.It WORKS!It's different from all the other books on the subject because it shows you HOWto take action, what steps to take, and how to get results. It's not just anecdotesand fluff -- it takes you through the process and practically forces you to get results.If you only get one book on manifestation, make it this one."
925,4,Enjoyed the friendship between Jim and Buck.  The romance between Jim and Pennie was also nice to see.  Once I started reading this book I did not want to put it down.  I will read more by this author.
926,5,"This is one of my favorite authors. Sometimes it's predictable but she always adds an extra twist to all of her books. This was a fun read,had all the elements for a good  book, humor, sex and fascinating characters. A great love story."
927,4,"I'm anxious to read the other two in this series.  JUST A FUN OLDER LADY AND HER PENCHANT FOR SOLVING MURDERS. Funny, i have lived all over and traveled a lot and never encountered a single murder but Aggie sees dead people elsewhere.  Oh well ir was a good story anyway.  There were a few editing defugalities."
928,5,"Yay!!! I only have 1 more book and I am caught up o n this series. OK Elle, when is the next book coming out."
929,4,I have been a fan of J A Konrath for some time now. I enjoy his writing style and the characters he creates. This book of short stories is a sample pack of some of his books. I will be buying and reading 2 of the books previewed here. This is a good way to get your feet wet if you haven't read his books yet.
930,2,And my but is very personal: I just don't want to get to know the main character who lays beside his wife in bed imagining how he could kill her with the knife he holds.  Don't need it.
931,3,"With a life of one day it is very difficult to rate a newspaper  - they are read for news and other items and serve an extremely practical purpose.  The New York Times has a good reputation and that stands  and whilst in the USA it is a good daily read with interesting articles, news items etc.  If it wasn't up to standard, it would fade away very quickly so &#34;reviewing it&#34; is a little unnecessary.  Enjoy the paper, read it for leisure and information and be thankful you don't live in a nation without such information readily available and virtually free."
932,5,"perfectly representative of the best Konrath and Crouch have to offer to their readers.When this team decides to really get into it, the results are amazing, and the books, long after being read, stick with us.Keep up the good work, guys!"
933,5,"I did enjoy this book, but at this point I have not found of a book by Lora Leigh, that I have not enjoyed.I would recommend this series. She had done a good job at keeping the character going through the series"
934,5,I read this book in about five hours and I loved it just as much if not more than the first. The story continues smoothly from the first to the second. Can't wait for the next book in the series.
935,4,"This was a nice story to read once you got past all the comparisons to everything. This would be appropriate for any reader. I gave this 4 stars for a couple of reasons. For example... One, some of the descriptions were annoying. I know what the color of grass is and don't have to be told every time the grass is mentioned. Two, the author would describe something and compare it to  what was just written to make us see fully I suppose. If you enjoy that type of thing, that's great and I enjoy it in some instances to get a clearer picture of what is being described but some things don't need anything further. Three, the story ended abruptly. I didn't see it coming as quickly as it did.Even after saying all that, I really enjoyed reading this and would like to read more of the story.  The characters were awesome and I could picture the story in my mind while reading.CST"
936,5,"Going into it know it would be brief, it was great. :) Just enough background to get to know the characters and make  you want them to get their happy ending. :)"
937,4,"I just read this for the third time, so it just goes to show that it is a story that I like a lot. The competitive nature of the relationship between the hero and heroine is a foil for the loving friendship that they have. The chemistry is sizzling."
938,4,loved this story. you can feel the love between them from the first page to blast. one of my favorites
939,2,"From what I understand, this is Mari Carr's first published piece and frankly, it kind of reads that way. I liked the two main characters and enjoyed their connection, plus there were some places with decent chemistry and sizzle. Overall though, it all felt very inconsistent. At some points Ross seems very alpha, at others we're told he's alpha but really see no evidence of that.The beginning of their sexual relationship felt a little awkward, with them running hot and cold and bouncing around back and forth on what they understand their relationship to be. The whole thing felt choppy, the love scenes short, jumping from one to another, then skipping a few days, etc. There were only a few lines in each scene that started to make me feel hot and bothered, and then it would sizzle away. It sometimes seemed like the ingredients were there, but for some reason they didn't come together as they should and it ended up feeling ... flat.One *HUGE* complaint I have: They start off almost at the beginning with role-playing - and role-playing in which Julia is a captive or sex slave, i.e. she's supposed to be somewhat resisting. While resistance is not a big part of the role-playing, it's still present, so I found it extremely disturbing that there was no safe word and they didn't lay down any rules or understandings beforehand.As I said before, I liked Julia and Ross and really enjoyed their friendship and the dialogue back-and-forth between them. I think the story could have turned out far better if that part had been more heavily explored and the sexual component of their relationship slowly integrated in. A really fantastic example of this that I read recently was Claire Matthews'Intimate Friends. That novella is even shorter, so the length constraint is greater and they start sleeping together pretty early on, however it felt much smoother and worked far better than in this case.ROMANCE NOVELLA RECOMMENDATIONS:*Intimate Friendsby Claire Matthews (4.5 stars)*Hearts In Darknessby Laura Kaye (4.5 stars)*Willing Victimby Cara McKenna (4 stars)"
940,4,"I just finishedBlind Malice (Rachel Myers Murder Mysteries)the 1st book of Rachel Myers mysteries, and I loved the way Ms.Jackson describes life in the Appalachian Mountain with some histoy facts thrown in. A very beautiful and interesting place to grow up in.Issac remind's me of a man I knew on a farm close to the one I grew up on.  A lot of respect for this man.I really liked the way this author went about finding out how her father died. A very good story and I will be reading the other 8 stories in this series for sure.Annis Ward Jackson your story has me going to 1 click your 2nd book in this series ( .#2 Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge (Rachel Myers Murder Mysteries) to see what happens with David,  Rachel,  Issac and the farm."
941,5,"Okay, if you are interested in reading a book written above a 5th or 6th grade reading level, I suggest this author. I am ashamed to say that I read the 50 Shades of Gray Trilogy. After having downloaded several of Evangeline Anderson's books, I laugh at the 50 Shades of Gray series. If you are going to write BDSM erotica, then for goodness sake, WRITE IT and do not put statements such as ""Geez, that was an incredible orgasm!"" Geez? I mean really.... Love Evangeline's books. There is an actual plot, interesting characters......much more sophisticated writing. Loved this one! I wish there were more with these two characters. My only criticism would be that I want more of the same characters."
942,2,"The premise of this book is neat: a crew of an experimental sub goes through something extraordinary and finds themselves in a future where society has broken down. At the same time, a few survivors of an alien attack on Mars must make their way back to Earth via capture by the aliens. It was interesting at first but I found many of the characters were easily interchangeable, mainly the leaders of the two groups and the military men on Mars. In fact, one of the latter was so easily overlooked as to stop existing in the middle of the book! He wasn't killed, didn't wander off of the space ship and get lost, no suspended animation or the equivalent; he just stopped existing in the story. Clapton, where are you?The characters also seem to spend a lot of time thinking about the opposite sex even though their lives are all in danger almost constantly. The female who is nominally in charge of the sub when the captain and 3 other members of the crew go ashore, is so worried about the captain (though not the other 3 people) that she sends two more people out into the unknown to find him. And none of the other crew members went, ""Wait. What?""Now the captain phones home and says, ""we're fine but you need to recall those men because there are bands of dangerous people wandering around who could kill them."" This news is passed onto our two wandering rescuers who promptly throw more wood on their fire. If this is the gene pool for humanity, we're in serious trouble.At this point, I don't think I'll finish the book even though I'm 60% through it. I have too many others interesting books on my list to fight my way through this."
943,5,"This paranormal romance is a keeper! It's even better than the first novel in the seriesWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1. Tad and Missy are so complimentary as a couple. They  balance each other, and their relationship is well developed. This author really draws you in, and you care about the characters, and what happens to them.I literally couldn't put this one down until I finished it. Enjoy!"
944,4,the lady and her boss were both feeling each other but were afraided to admit it to one another untill she dressed up like a hoochie momma to get his attentation then it was on from there.
945,4,"Cassandra finds herself faced with a new suitor, Emerson Bryce--one that her parents greatly admire, and one who could take care of her and make her comfortable for the rest of her life. The only problem is, one year ago she gave her heart away to another. Granted, the man she loves, Fredrick, has died in the war, but that doesn't stop her feelings for him--hence the ""Dilemma of the Heart.""This is a super quick, fun, historical read."
946,4,As usual her books are a good read and I enjoyed this one too. Her writing is great most of the time and worth rereading.
947,3,I do not really consider this a BDSM book.  This is more of a romantic book and it was not really that great.
948,3,I liked this book but it was kind of silly.  That's all I have to say. all done writing i.

The next morning Alicia, slipped out of Adam's house and walked away. During the next four months she often wondered about him. She didn't even have his last name. She was called into her boss's office. She didn't even know her boss, or shall I say she didn't think she did. She was speechless when she found out her boss was Adam. She was even more shocked when he accused her of stealing from the company. Alicia had two choices, Jail time, or to be Adam's mistress... She became Adam's mistress, hoping that would give her time to prove her innocents. This was a good books. I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing from the plot... The sparks between Adam, and Alicia was there. it did turn out to be a sweet romance."

954,5,"This story kept me turning the pages. Great suspense, smokin' hot chemistry and a satisfying ending. Who could ask for more?"
955,4,"The story premise was cute. Hunky editor ""tricks"" his prized writer into learning more about his desires. She thinks he's too hot to be interested. He's decided to go for broke to show her what she means to him. And, he's trying to bring her out of her funk after her cat died and show her that she CAN let someone get close enough for her to love. A handy snowstorm comes along to trap them together. It was very erotic, as the title suggests. Good, hot, short read. I will have to find more from Mari Carr."
956,3,This was a couple of short stories that were enjoyable. Fast fairytales. Good for middle grade and up. I give them 3 stars.
957,5,"I was genuinely surprised at how good, realistic and simple this story was. No one was pining to death over the simplest glance or touch. I especially liked how the heroine wasn't a drama queen over his new love interest especially as this had been apart more years than they had been together.Even his difficulty in being her boss and letting her take the brunt of the flack for her overly investigative style from his staff was spot on - made me love them both more. LolWill be looking forward with less trepidation at other medical romances and books by this author..."
958,3,"Sacred Fate by Eresse is set in a hermaphroditic society with lashings of fantasy and rather epic world building. The story was pretty engrossing and a lot of that is down to the world she's created and solid story telling. I did get a little lost when I started it due to the many characters initially introduced and it was difficult to distinguish between them. I liked the story for the most part, but found the Lassen very hard to warm to and Rohyr almost too overbearing. An interesting and unique story."
959,2,Rgua story was ok . Wasn't awful ; had it's semi erotic moments but I felt it kind of lost its potential and rushed to finish  an OK 15 min read ... But not the best.
960,5,This is a great book. I enjoyed the characters and the story line.  It was a good read and didn't require a lot of thought.
961,5,"SF today seems mostly about space armies and evil corporations; these stories are about ideas (plus a few plain old adventures). This book will make you think, and perhaps, smile at a cleverly-ironic conclusion. Recommended."
962,3,I only gave it 3 out of five because well itsnt black dagger brotherhood or anything but it is a great story and you wont be dissappointed. It was read in a few hours but was well written and a cute story. If you are looking for a free book and that will keep you entertained then this is your book.
963,2,Very little story just over the top bdsm. 9/10 of this book was one sex act after another. The male lead was weak as was the storyline. I had hoped for a more developed story. It was definitely not worth the money.
964,3,"Still not actually read this, I've been busy and very distracted by other things to read/do and boyfriend got this but also hasn't read it to challenge his fear of the ocean."
965,3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author, whoever it was, captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action, but not a bad little love story."
966,3,"Normally, I wouldn't read these kind of book anymore.  Not as much enjoyment, and I don't need much more of this kind of education. Okay, so this is just me.  It's a good book for learning what went on back in those days.  Try ut, you may like it!Lou"
967,1,"It was to short. And u don't know half of what was happening. The story could have been better. W as just crying because she was praying. Maybe I have to re-read to If I had known this was a manga story by an American, I would not have gotten it. It was a BIG disappointment. I guess you can't trust free stuff."
968,5,Part of the WesternWind Series and another winner for Charlee.  Her Reapers are just fantastic.  A definite must read!!
969,5,"I love Ms. Sutton's writing! Her stories dig deep into the inner soul of her characters and deal with issues and feelings and longings that are common to us all, but ones which the typical Christian novel does not deal with. Where other novels gloss over our inner urgings, Ms. Sutton faces them head on without fear. I would say this particular story deals with lust vs. love. What is the difference? What does God say about this? He created our attractions, after all. They are not inherently evil. But what do we do with them? How can we harness them in a world where no one seems to?  Although there is alot of sexual innuendos in this book, there has to be in order to get the points Ms. Sutton wishes to get across. The characters are real and likeable and we really feel for them.  Let's face it, all of us have been in similar situations. Some of us have fallen. Others have overcome.Ms. Sutton's writing is crisp, simple, and clear and makes for an enjoyable, fast read. Personally, I would recommend this book to anyone, even as young as 12. My reason? They are going to face these issues in school and with their peer. Why not face them in a story where the characters make the right choices and God is glorified.  Bravo to Ms. Sutton!"
970,5,"I loved this story of the future and survival after humans tried their best to destroy our beautiful planet. The beings that peopled these pages brought me to tears, laughter, a feeling of wonder and great love. I can hardly wait to read the next book..."
971,5,"Opening line: ""The long, wet spring had finally turned the corner into a Connecticut summer so glorious that the residents of Old Wethersfield decided among ourselves it had probably been worth the wait.""The protagonist, Kate Lawrence, and her daughter, Emma, are out for a walk, watching the swans in a local pond, chatting about their immediate plans. Kate snaps photos of the swans - two parent swans with their four little cygnets - to document their progress.Kate is co-owner of MACK Realty and Emma, a paralegal, is launching a real estate law practice with a friend. The morning walk mixes business with pleasure. Mother and daughter admire properties as they hike ""the loop"" where ""nearly every Cape Cod, Colonial, Victorian and farmhouse along our route shone with fresh paint and liberally applied elbow grease.""So what can go wrong on such a glorious summer morning? The answer waits in Kate's office. Someone has sent her the stinking bud of a corpse flower and a clipping about the plant's anticipated flowering at the end of June. The anonymous gift is wrapped in a sheet of paper with scribbling in the margin: ""It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you. And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink.""The poison pen letter is almost ignored in the confusion that results when a plumber finds a skeleton hidden in an historic house belonging to ""the Henstock girls."" The ""girls"" are the spinster sisters Ada and Lavinia, now in their eighties.By the time the cops arrive, the skeleton has disappeared. It promptly turns up in photos Kate took of the swans swimming serenely in the pond, and the anonymous letter writer strikes again. There's another clipping about the stinky corpse flower and this time the scribbling reads: ""The lovesick, the betrayed, and the jealous all smell alike.""So much for a ho-hum life in the quaint little town of Wethersfield.The poison pen letters seem directed to Kate, who is on the verge of cohabitation with Armando, an attractive South American transplant who is the controller of a telecommunications company. However, the letters could as easily be directed to her two partners: Margo, a southern belle who is in a relationship with a cop named John, and ""Strutter,"" a Jamaican immigrant, whose husband is also named John.Kate is a magnet for trouble. She's tailed by someone driving a black van. The man knocks on her door late at night. Does she call the cops? No, she calls one of her partners and the cops come swarming in. Meanwhile, the plumber who discovered the skeleton in the Henstock house is nowhere to be found - fake ID, non-working cell phone number.And what about those pesky letters? When Kate is mugged in a parking lot, the investigation kicks into high gear.Kate is an amateur sleuth in the tradition of Miss Marple and Jessica Fletcher, attuned to the people in her small town, pooh-poohing any perceived danger to herself, quick to give others the benefit of a doubt.Some minor nitpicks: In one place, Kate's relationship with Armando lasted 8 years; in another it's 7 years; and in yet another she has known him for 5 years. Also, Margo's speech is full of dropped ""g's"" when a couple of instances would have sufficed.This was a comfort read that I hated to see end. Like Kate, I was caught up in the goings-on in Wethersfield, curious about the skeleton and the fate of the two old sisters and wondering how Kate would adjust to Armando's moving in with her."
972,5,As Quinn McKay find himself in the verge of loosing his wife for his stubbornness he is forced to reevaluate his life and his relationship. But it is Libby herself who lets him know that a woman has needs other than a good house and a steady income.When Quinn and Libby go back to basics it is here where they remember why they decided to get married and spend the rest of their lives together. Because they are explosive together and each have what the other needs.I like how in this story we get shown that no matter how long you know a person there is always something new to explore even if it's something old...
973,4,"An interesting book. I found it too short though. The ending also went too quick. 1 minute she had time, then she was dead, brought back and taken away because she was Fae. A lot of explanation needed to be added to better understand how things were supposed to work. Still all in all a good story."
974,5,I love this book and it's functionality. Great in Sunday School because I can get to the chapters and verses very quickly.
975,4,My only complaint is that it is so short. I wanted to know more. The characters and descriptions are fantastic! The title perfectly captures the elements of the story (don't want to give spoilers). I want MORE of these characters&#8230;and I'm hoping the author will consider that.
976,5,"Plot/Storyline: 4 3/4 StarsFirst, I would like to mention that this is an extremely long novel. However, unlike many of the Indie novels that are very long, I did not find this one in need of much `cutting'. Sure, there were a few superfluous scenes that did not necessarily forward the plot. There were very few, though, and the author still managed to make them intriguing enough to hold interest.This epic tale opens with a spooky, confusing prologue. Next up is a scene from the viewpoint of Detective Derek, who is trying to solve the murder of a young girl. The rest of the novel is from the viewpoint of Elisse, an expert on Mozart, who has been inadvertently drawn into the investigation by the Detective. He contacts her regarding a letter found on the murder victim's body. What's so special about the letter? It's clearly new, yet signed by Wolfgang Mozart.The book strikes a flawless note with Elisse and her knowledge tempered by innate suspicion. Her investigation, while amateur at best, is the perfect vehicle for introducing William Masters, a man who believes he is Mozart.Elisse and Masters make a harmonic couple with chemistry aplenty. Edward, Masters' psychiatrist, is an interesting foil for a love triangle.Throughout several climactic scenes, the reader will find that no one is as they appear.There are multiple escapes along with requisite recaptures, both of which are done with edge-of-your-seat action. Never does the author stray into the realm of the fantastic to save his heroes and heroine. The action is compelling and logical.While some technological and scientific information regarding time travel is the backbone of this work, the author manages to keep the explanations to a bare minimum. This maintains the flow of relaxed reading for which this novel excels.There was one scene I questioned: Our intrepid heroes go to an ATM machine at an airport and not only manage to withdraw $4,000 in cash, but also transfer over $400,000 to another account overseas. To my knowledge, that is stretching the bound of ATM machine usage a bit far.I did find the ""evil one"" (using this term to avoid spoilers) to be a bit overdone with the `powers' bestowed on them. There was a statement made in an attempt to explain this, but nothing further was revealed.The ending was truly satisfying, while still leaving room for a sequel, that I can't help but hope is forthcoming.Character Development: 5 StarsElisse is a deep and interesting character. I truly enjoyed the telling of the story from her viewpoint. At times, it was a bit difficult to discern her motivations when it came to the romance with Mr. Masters; however, I eventually understood her feelings through her conversations with others and with William.William Masters is the star of this work. Amazingly, the author manages to keep him in character at all times, with no discernible mistakes. He is humorous, outrageous, interesting, and imminently loveable. His reactions to things of his new century are spot-on!This novel includes an eclectic cast of side characters. All of them are unique and well defined.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Carroll's prose will keep you engrossed in this novel. The flow of his sentences makes for easy, yet intelligent, reading. He provides detailed descriptions when needed, without wasting words on unimportant scenery.The dialogues are realistic and in character for every conversation. You can truly hear the voices of every person in the novel. You may very well be hearing them long after you finish reading.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThe formatting was of professional quality.I find it very hard to rate the editing of this work. The novel is exceptionally long, so I am taking into account the `percentage' of errors. There were quite a few issues, mostly with missing words, which were nonetheless easy to fill in from sentence context. One of the oddest issues was the word `coincident' replacing `coincidence' in every instance.However, with the length of this novel, I would have to say the percentage of errors was low enough to not spoil the reading experience.Rating: PG-13 for Light Violence and Sexual Innuendo"
977,4,"Great characters, cool storyline and great scenes. Would definitely recommend reading (but that's true of every Mari Carr book I've read)."
978,3,"I downloaded this book because I had seen the movie and I had enjoyed it.  Being a realist I wanted to see to what extent had the producers and screenwriters gone in taking this story from book form and turning it into a major motion picture.  Needless to say that beyond keeping the original story concept, that of a person born old and aging backwards Hollywood did a complete makeover.  So how was the original story?  While creative and interesting, it didn&#8217;t grab me in the same way as the movie did.  In fact, I found the main character less sympathetic in the book in comparison to the portrayal in the movie.  True it was sad that Benjamin Button ends up dying forsaken by his family in the book, but the sadness is not the same as what is portrayed on the big screen.  As for the other stories in the collection, all were enjoyable to read, however none of them really grabbed me.  Of the other short stories, only &#34;Dalyrimple Goes Wrong&#34; put a smile on my face.  The other tales all end on a down note for the central character with them either suffering social stigmatism as in &#34;Bernice Bobs Her Hair&#34; or loses out on love as in &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221;.  In &#8220;Dalyrimple Goes Wrong&#8221; the main character wins out in the end, achieving social acceptance and economic reward at the end of the story, even though the main character actually turns his back on society and becomes a criminal during the course of the story.  Of course, all the stories address moral issues; however, I found it hard to accept how these issues were resolved in the tales.  Perhaps that is because of the changing times between now when I am reading the stories and then when F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote the stories.  Still it was difficult to accept that a young girl who gets her hair bobbed is ostracized (though she does get her revenge) and a guy who turns to theft to support a life style that he feels is his right, gets a chance to run for public office.  In the end, however I must acknowledge that the stories were well written and interesting.  They were also very different from what I have read before and that is why I&#8217;m giving this book three-stars."
979,3,"Honestly I read this book because I got it free on Kindle - through my iphone.  This book introduces you to Jane, a submissive, who becomes celibate after she finds out her Master is a married man.  She attends a BDSM themed birthday party, with her best friend.  The book, couple of short chapters, covers only one night in the weekend.  You have to purchased the next to books,Educating Jane Porter: A Jane Porter storyandReinventing Jane Porter: Jane Porter Series, Book 3,to get the rest of the weekend."
980,5,"Rebecca Small is an intern for a museum. She is fascinated with pirate captain James Morrow. As she organizes his belongings for display, she reaches for a dagger that belonged to him. Once she touches the dagger, she is pulled back in time to the year 1715 where Rebecca finds herself fighting alongside James on his pirate ship.James is baffled by his wife's sudden change. Where once she fought him and held him with disdain, now she fights alongside him and surrenders to his passion. As the days pass, this new Rebecca intrigues and fascinates him. He is drawn to her but he doesn't trust easily. James' plan was to take his obstinate wife to Barbados and leave her but now he's not so sure. Is this a trick or has his wife really become his soul mate?Crystal Jordan's angle on time travel in Treasured is one I've not read before. I really liked it. James is sexy and commanding and Rebecca is definitely his perfect match. Treasured is a very steamy romance with a great storyline.Nannettereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
981,5,"After reading this book, I read the reviews. I can't help but disagree with the one bad review. Yes Cain is cold and controlling, yes he treats Katie as if he only wants sex from her, but she still sees enough in him to fall in love with him. The point of the story is that her love is strong enough to pull hin out of his self loathing and see himself as she sees him. I found it a very powerful story with a whole run through my emotions. It was also a sexy and hot read. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a strong story with a happy ending. Enjoy!!!"
982,5,This was an interesting story.  I will never think the same about Walt Disney's fairy princesses again.  You couldn't help but root for the heroine and her tenacity. The end was completely unexpected to me. I recommend this book to fantasy lovers.
983,5,"I enjoyed all of these quotes from the Bible and other sources, including Shakespearean plays.  They were all interesting and relevant to life."
984,5,My first read fir this author was very impressed. I was so caught up I read in a day I love books that pull you in to the story so well you don't want to put down and sad to see it end
985,4,"I enjoyed it. I didn't pay the $2.99 price. I think I paid after tax more along the lines of $1.58? Anyways, it was enjoyable. Not enough for me to explore her other work but it filled all the roles I was looking for in a short story. Instant attraction, believable time lapse and semi-believable circumstances. If you're looking for a steamy light read, you found it."
986,4,"In these stories everybody smokes.  The courtesy of offering a pack of cigarettes is common. The characters are classic 50s people, as are the social proprieties. The illustrations are highly representative of the 50s science/fiction dime novel, and the magazines of that time. Although he was not the first to deal with the principle of multiple time lines, I think he was the first to base a series of stories on the concept. These have not aged well, but the science behind these stories are still valid. I will have to admit I read these stories after Fuzzy Sapiens, his masterpiece, and one of the top books of all time, certainly in this genre. We lost a great storyteller prematurely when he left us."
987,5,"Wow!  Two families who had no idea about  each other.  Husband doesn't think he did anything wrong.  Justice system agrees-unbelievable!  Reenie and Liz are duped into thinking they are the wife of Keith, who travels, a lot.  Liz' brother knows something's not right and catches him in the act.  So begins the unraveling of two families.  Trying to find their way back to normalcy is difficult especially in a small town and especially when one family moves there to be near the husband.  I couldn't put this book down because I wanted to see what happened to each.  One wife finds love with the most unexpected person.  Great read!  Ms Novak always writes great stories!!  On to the other wife's HEA!"
988,2,"Plot/Storyline: 2 StarsThe novel started with a storline that was reminiscent of modern day Lord of the Flies, by William Golding. Unfortunately, that small similarity of teens building their own society is pretty much it for likeness.The premise is faulty from the beginning. A bunch of young kids are camping. I'm not certain of the youngest, but the oldest camper is seventeen. I know at least one is as young as thirteen. Then, when communication is cut off with the outside world, five of the six counselors leave the sixth and youngest counselor, a twenty-year old alone with all those teenagers. I cannot imagine any adults making such a decision.Then, out of all those kids and the one counselor, only one teen decides to try to find out what happened. I would have thought several would have wanted to hike down the mountain to find some adults, but the rest almost immediately start deciding what to do about winter, just assuming they will be there still.Any sense of suspense is ruined constantly by little remarks thrown in referring to things way into the future. The author seemed intent on making sure the reader knew that the kids would never be `rescued' from the very beginning. The kids certainly don't seem very concerned about being rescued with all of them willing to pretty much blindly follow one of the youngest boys in the group.The plot has very little to do with the fog or its origins. It simply focused completely on these kids creating a little society of their own. I will say that it was obvious that a lot of thought and planning went into the storyline. But, the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.Character Development: 1 StarThe characters were flat and lifeless. The author was disinclined to give any back story on the main characters, so the reader must draw their own conclusions as to the kids' personalities and how they came to be.Writing Style: 2 StarsWhereas the subject matter may not be appropriate for young teens, the writing style was of that type of simplicity. Not only was the sentence structure coarse and unrefined, but the flow came in staccato bursts that was just exhausting to read. The time flow explanations were confusing, too.The descriptions were so sparse that I could not picture a character or a scene during the entire novel. The dialogue was decent in some places, but mostly stilted and uninteresting.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors throughout, but not enough to be a big issue. The formatting was of professional quality.Rating: PG-17 for Violence, Rape, and Adult Situations"
989,4,"Description: Sommer McGregor the adopted daughter of werewolves decides to open a catering business and take on a lover. Her best friend and Alpha-in-Waiting, Caleb Masters, is more than willing to help her with that challenge.The Good: Sommer needs saving, relationship and career-wise, but she resists Caleb's help. This makes for a surprisingly relatable emotional story. Caleb is a great Alpha. He knows what he wants, and goes after Sommer hard. I also love that they were friends first, passionate lovers second. And their meddlesome family members are both funny and lovable.The Bad: Caleb's tail pops out when he's turned on, which comes off more weird than sexy. And there's a marking of mate that never really pays off.The Naughty: Erotic Content, Anal, and forced seduction.Editing issues: NoFinal Grade: B"
990,4,"If you like no holds barred then you will like it but the ending was weird and too short, not a serious read"
991,5,"This is a spellbinding tale of intrigue, kidnapping, danger, passion and of course, love. Michael and Hannah are two complex characters I thoroughly enjoyed!"
992,5,"The book involved, along with the book you read, are both priceless.Of course, 'The Dickens' isn't real, but it's believable.The love story between the two main characters, is well developed.You are taken through so many emotions to the climax at the endthat was, no doubt, inevitiable, considering the story.This was the first book that I have read by this author but itmost certainly won't be the last!And the title, is a little gift all it's own and is brilliant!I really can't say enough good things about this book.Get it!  Read it!  Tell your friends about it!"
993,4,"Very sensual and fun story.  What a great way to bring to characters together.  It would have been better if the armband actually was magically.  The story reminded me a little of ""The Italian Job"" without the violence.  It would be great if there was a sequel to this story also."
994,4,"A summer camp for teens is shut off from the rest of civilization.  They are a diverse group - ethnicity as well as religion.  Realizing that no help will be coming, they eventually look to Mike for clearance - &#34;Chief&#34; Mike.Exploring the area leads them to the discovery that there is a fog below them in the mountain area.I didn't think I would like this book but I ended up thinking that it is a good solid read.  The youngsters in this camp banded together and fell in step behind Chief Mike.  He had some harsh rules which had to be followed.Eventually, this group finds several others nearby and some of the older ones help the group become better.  There are, of course, some evil people out there that have to dealt with.  They even find a small group of Army personnel that were stranded when the fog hit.Amazing what ingenuity can do in the face of despair.  And, living off the land certainly helped them get ready for the cold winter.Highly recommended."
995,3,"This was my introduction to this author.  It is a quick read and I was impressed - it peaked my interest in the series.  I am not going to summarize the story because everyone has already done an excellent job of that.This was worth the download; I would have even bought it had the first in the series been the free one.  Just to continue the series - quick - easy reads.  I am starting on the third,Heat of the Storm: An Out of Uniform Story.now.These are the books in the series -Heat of the Moment: A Red-Hot Summer story.-  Seems to come before this book - since it is the story of Shelby Harper and John Garrett.  Also it appears to introduce Carson Scott.  He is a third for this couple.  I would have liked to of read this one first but, it wasn't the free one.Heat of Passion: An Out of Uniform story.Heat of the Storm: An Out of Uniform Story.-  This is Lieutenant Will Charleston story - he is introduced in Heat of Passion.  I am very interested in reading his story.  I like stories where the couple start off as friend, wanting more."
996,2,It's gay sex written for women who like M/M action. Things happen immediately - no one has any control or finesse. If you like that sort of Insta-Luv drivel then this might be a story for you.
997,4,Basically the same storyline as the first slight different characters. Again I am happen that Kimberly and Anthony ended up together. Loved the fact that Niche made a chance in his life and he and Amanda decided to get married. Let's see what will happen to Lethal Heart in the next part. Good book.

999,1,"SPOILER ALERT!!!The book was all sex...She dumps her cheating boyfriend and her best friend (who is male) tells her he wants to give her ""lessons"" in bed. She agrees, they have sex, tell each other they love each other...the end.I hardly ever give a negative review to a book, and out of the 190 something books I've read, this may only be the 3rd/4th book that I had to make myself finish reading....there was just no substance."
1000,4,"I don't have much to say about Angel's Pawn. I liked it but I didn't love it. Maybe I was expecting they'd have a definite stand with each other in the end. It was open-ended so maybe I have to check the other books for progress.Anyways, I enjoyed it. I like Ashwini. But I didn't get to know her well. She had so many secrets until the end. I love Janvier. What's there not to love? He's funny, smart, strong, and gorgeous. Their love hate relationship is kinda fun, too. The chemistry is undeniable when they're together so I was expecting for more sexy scenes.I liked the plot. It was interesting and intriguing. So overall, this was a good novella. But I liked the first two better.My Rating: 3.8 stars out of 5"
1001,4,Now that I have read all the works of Jules Verne...this one wasn't too bad and kept my interest. Even though movies have been made from Verne's publications from long ago...the movies in my opinion don't do justice to the books. For my liking I still think Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is his best.
1002,4,"Seriously, what's not to like about this short-short?Max did something spectacular before birth, yet lost the details of it as he grew older.Just read it!"
1003,4,"Since her father's death, Penny's been plagued by troubles on the ranch and sinister characters have been lurking about, and though she doesn't like the idea much, she feels she has no choice but to send for a mail order husband, dreaming of a knight in shining armor coming to right all her problems, despite her professed pessimism regarding the scheme. Penny and Jace were such engaging characters, making great equal partners when it was called for, but also falling easily into the more traditional roles of meek woman and strong, protective man at other times, and it was fascinating to see the movement back and forth between the two. The mistaken assumptions on both sides throughout the story became frustrating and by the end it was heartbreaking to see the characters following through with noble actions that neither of them wanted. I'm glad it all worked out in the end, but I wish things could have been resolved a bit sooner. The humorous bits sprinkled throughout the story were great!"

Antonio and Santos enjoy sharing a woman and Jane's about to experience being mastered by not one but two men.Jane and her best friend and business partner, Lily's company R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up the events this weekend. However, it's their extracurricular activities that are holding their attention.  Jane's caught up in her sexual encounter with Antonio and the new knowledge that he shares women with his best friend Santos.  She has to admit that it's a fantasy she enjoys but never seriously considered being in such a situation herself - until cornered by Antonio and Santos.Her friend Lily had her own sexual experience but her emotions are in a tizzy over the event.  Lily and Jean Jacques are strong minded individuals and he's definitely a Dominant male so the simple fact that she won't accept his dominance over her is going to cause all sorts of problems.  Jealousy, hurt, and a power struggle are at the forefront of their relationship.  Can they get past their need for control and admit to their feelings?I've reached the conclusion that Dominique Adair is a cruel woman - or maybe she just enjoys teasing us - in either case, she's definitely got me hooked with her JANE PORTER stories!  These stories capture your attention from the very beginning, build your anticipation, engage your emotions - and then you discover that you'll have to wait for the next story to find out what happens next - and believe me, you'll want to know what happens next.  These characters are highly memorable, the sex scenes are beyond hot and conversations are delightfully wicked.  I've got a real fondness for Jane, Antonio and Santos, but I have to confess it's Lily and Jean Jacques battle of wills that really holds my attention and makes `angry sex' so very appealing.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
1005,5,I love this book it shows one that you can love someone as well as self when someone has brought you pain. Once again Mrs.Hubbard u have outdid yourself waiting on Lethal's story
1006,5,I had just gotten a Kindle sample and then ordered the whole set of books.  I really enjoyed reading them all.
1007,3,I have to say I was a little disappointed in the ending of this series. The way things came about and the way the women were handling things were more irritating than endearing.
1008,3,"A 3.5 and a good read. Too short. Definitely wanted more and the ending was too rushed.  Hell, the entire relationship was too rushed.  But a good read."
1009,4,"I really was completely surprised at almost every point by the turns of events in this book. Some were disappointing but most were thrilling. One thing I would've liked to have seen done differently and that was who Raven ended up giving her heart to. He didn't thrill me as much as another in the book did. As a fact he was kinda boring to me. Maybe I would've liked him better if there'd been more background on how he was viewed by others who one  him before he met raven. As it was, although the author stated that he was dangerous and exciting, his actions didn't lead me to that conclusion. The only thing I got from him was that he fell in love with Raven the moment he saw her and was a lovesick puppy from then on. He says, later on in the book that he's never had feelings for any other female but I didn't quite believe it considering how quickly he admitted to feelings for raven. The elf Prince, on the other hand, would've been more believable. It was established early on that he was feared by everyone, he used females flippantly and was used to getting what he wanted until he meets raven and he's left flabbergasted. He doesn't know what to do. He's left confused. I would say that the book wished for him to be the hero/lover of this book, and it seemed as though that's the way it was goin  until drake pops in outta nowhere."
1010,4,Written in a different era it still enthralls. I read Bulldog Drummond as a kid and it seemed wonderful then. It is still good now but the writing is dated and some expressions and points of view are clearly politically incorrect. Steer past that and the stories are fun to read and like James Bond for the early 20th Century. The writing reminds me of the Biggles books.
1011,4,"In the rather corpulent and bloated market of supernatural romances, this book stands out with its more creative setting and characters. Like a dark Alice in Wonderland, poor Two falls down the rabbit hole of vice and is mysteriously rescued by Theroen. Theroen, as anybody can guess, is a vampire and he introduces her into a dark world of violence and suspense. Readers are kept on the edge, by not knowing how characters would react and whether there would be indeed a happy ending for the characters. The ending is rather open ended, which I suppose gives a good platform for a sequel, but is not as satisfying."
1012,3,The story started as a slow dull story and remained slow but I was determined to finish it.  It had a good story line but was a force-myself-to-finish book.
1013,4,"There were several errors. For one, when did Mercedes get married? There were references to her marriage & divorce but I don't recall either situation. And words were hyphenated unnecessarily, such as one syllable words or 2 letter words. Sometimes the story just jumped into something else. And for Rico to be so hard when she met him, he sure turned soft quick. And the story just ended with no warning. I will probably look for the second part but I won't make a run for it"
1014,3,"When I was a child my parents loved these stories - made into several movies - and of course, I thought they were boring and old fashioned.Well, they're still old fashioned, but in a comforting, old world way.  The stories are set in the British Isles for the most part, between WWI and WWII.  Bulldog Drummond makes a habit of saving damsel's in distress with flair and dash.  There's no bad language, course innuendo or explicit sex or violence, just interesting narrative and story lines.  Great for a quiet rainy Sunday."
1015,2,"I got this one for free. It was too short. The characters were not developed, and the storyline was iffy at best."
1016,5,This is a great story about a woman who is abducted by aliens and basically treated like a wild animal and eventually a sex toy for her Master.  This definitly has age play aspects and harsh punishments. But boy is it a fun to read how the two main characters interact and eventually have feelings for each other other than Master/Pet.
1017,5,"The story line in this book rocks.  The two main characters are awesome to get to know.  This book has everything danger, drama, love, and lover jealous. The pace of this book is great and page turner from this first page.  I couldnt put it down and I loved both character and what they go through for love.  I'm new to the m/m books but I love this one and the sex scenes are very well written too :)."
1018,5,"As a former correctional officer for TDCJ, it was hard for me to believe that those who had been inside could really change. This book helped me to see how great our God is and that He can change anyone willing to accept and follow Him. The world has lost a great man of GOD."
1019,5,"Paige Warren's Unexpected Wife is a wonderful story. I really enjoyed the romance. The sex was very tame, but it doesn't take anything away from the story of Ainsley and Braedan. The details and villains in this story are very detailed, and well written. While being a romance, there is also lots of action and drama. It's a fairly short story which just means you can read it twice. I would recommend Unexpected Wife to anyone. It has sex, dramatic twist, action, romance, and a happy ending. How could you go wrong? - Ammie"
1020,5,I liked this short story. I would like it if the author would rewrite this short story into a full length novel.  Wishful thinking.
1021,4,"Non dog-lovers need not worry about slushy anthropomorphism. Carstairs is a real 'doggy' kind of dog. Good mystery element and although the main female character is pretty 1-dimensional, the characters are interesting. A fun enjoyable read. I think I'll get the others."
1022,5,This is one of my favorite erotic stories. I loved the characters and the setting. It was just such a magical story and SO SO sexy! I'm hoping she will one day write a sequel to it so we can find out what happens with the heroines sister. I'm very curious about that.Reviewed this book for the author.
1023,5,"It's not easy finding post apocalyptic or post global disaster books that aren't either over the top in one way or another and it's been many years since I've had the chance to read one that didn't seem too outlandish or just wasn't set right.Mr. Sides first book in his Peacekeepers series accomplished that. I read the sample and immediately one-clicked the rest. I found his story setting, details, characters to all be well-written, highly detailed in the places where details counted and easily understood. Each character, from Jim, Patricia and down to little Evan were all real to me and that is a vital element for me as a reader.The action was well-founded, not cliched as some of these style books can be and never boring. I enjoyed his dialogue between the characters. Now as for some of the complaints listed in other reviews, I didn't see it. I didn't see Mr. Sides treating his female characters in anyway that degraded them or made them lesser characters and certainly while there was violence in this type of book I honestly would have wondered about it if there hadn't been. I certainly can say as a female reader that I wasn't offended and thought he handled Patricia very well.I don't normally give or say if you like a certain author then you will like so and so but in this case and for readers of the old Guardian series by Richard Austin then give this series a try."
1024,4,"Robin Hood is an offtold tale of the thief who stole from the rich to give to the poor. Here Robin is a princess of the realm who survived the assassination of her mother. She is raised by Friar Tuck in Sherwood Forrest and becomes a bandit. There is romance and adventure a plenty, and wonderful twists and turns to the plot. The characters are fun and believable. What more do you want?"
1025,5,Well nice reading and sexy Plan to read the rest later this year sexy I loved the plot and the billionaire of course
1026,1,Not very well written and unrealistic.
1027,5,It was nice to see that love can be found again when a mistake chases someone away. Loved it it
1028,4,I absolutely loved this book. Very descriptive a joy to read. Cain  was a deep character with many sides. Hard for me to put this one down.
1029,3,"** Note: this story appears as a bonus in the paperback edition of Survivor's Quest. **Fool's Bargain is a short story featuring the stormtroopers of Aurek-Four, a unit of the Imperial 501st Legion of the Empire of the Hand.  It takes place shortly before the events of Survivor's Quest, but is probably best read after.The Empire of the Hand is involved in a war to rid the native Eickarie people of their latest warlord, but the 501st curious orders are very specific - take the warlord alive.  This story is tightly focused, with a couple of characters firmly at the center.  There's good detail here but for some reason it doesn't feel as well developed as other short stories I've read by Zahn.  Also,  those who look for big names in their Star Wars stories will want to give this a pass.  A couple of minor characters from Survivor's Quest show up in largely supporting roles, but there are no movie characters nor beloved favorites here.But despite these caveats Fool's Bargain is a good short story that gives further glimpse of Zahn's take on stormtroopers, which he touched on in Survivor's Quest, and would continue to explore in later novels (Allegiance and Choices of One)."
1030,4,I enjoy reading books that were written long ago but forecast current genres. This book was old fashioned but fun to read. I'd get more by this author.

She's determined to keep her distance and guard her heart. Sasha doesn't want to step over the emotional line again, even though one look at the luscious hunk is enough to tempt an angel to sin...To be honest this kind of confused me. I got that it was an erotica. I got that it was futuristic. I did not however understand the competition. She didn't really delve into the whole rating part or what all was involved. This wasn't my favorite erotica I've ever read. I usually enjoy erotica but this one had just a little too much voyeurism, and the story line bounced all over the place. This was also supposed to be a romance, and it lived up to that much better. I enjoyed the play back and forth between Antonio and Sasha. All in all this book wasn't that great. I would give it a 3/5 it wasn't the worst thing I have read but wasn't the best. I will try another book by this author and see what that brings me."
1032,4,"Daniel ""Duke"" Warren and Maverick ""Mav"" Holmes are roommates and teammates.  They're also opposites, and sometimes Duke drives Mav insane.  Still, they're best friends, and they'd do anything for each other.  When Duke says he doesn't have enough money to make the rent, Mav's ready and willing to help him out--until he finds out how Duke intends to get the money.  Posing for a website called Str8te Boys doesn't seem like such a good idea.  On top of that, Duke's been challenging him to play ""gay chicken,"" a game of seeing how far you can go without freaking out.  Mav's confused, but things are about to get a lot more confusing...If you've read Evangeline Anderson before, you probably have an idea of what Str8te Boys is like.  It's a quick, hot story of two guys who have always seemed straight, and what happens when they get together.  Mav and Duke are both jocks.  In a lot of ways they're typical college guys.  Their complicated relationship is revealed in bits and pieces, and I could easily see why Mav was so confused.  The sex scenes are hot, and there's a nice dose of angst.  Str8te Boys isn't terribly deep, but it's a fun, hot read that makes for a nice distraction.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1033,4,"I have always been enamoured with the underdog coming out on top type of stories. Reminiscent of Anne of Green Gables stories, this book was a very delightful read."

1035,4,"""THE BLOOD THAT BONDS"" BY CHRISTOPHER BUECHELERA Vampire's need for a companion takes a heroin addicted hooker by the name of ""Two"" off the streets and into the realm of nightmares. Though Theroen had given her a new life, Two is having a hard time adjusting but learns quickly how to handle the change and seeks to help the other girls that are trapped by the pimp Darren.This story is well-written and has a bite that most fans of the supernatural will enjoy. While I did enjoy the story it was just a little of too much the same for me. Another basic Vampire falls in love with girl, girl becomes his companion, and eventually gets revenge on the ones that always treated her badly. If you enjoy this type of story you will definitely enjoy this book. I do recommend giving it a read.Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud"
1036,4,Sad to contemplate that there are people who have no conscious and value life so little that they can commit acts of terrorism.
1037,4,"Sorcha is a huntress for the goddess Rhiannon.  Her job is to hunt down and kill immortals that have broken the rules and gone rogue.  She's been gifted with certain abilities to help her in her job and she is used to being feared by all immortals--that is until she meets Cale.Cale is a shape-shifting gargoyle who has stolen a mystical dagger from Avalon. His brother has been cursed and is trapped in his stone form and Cale believes the dagger may be the key to reversing the curse.  He will stop at nothing to save his brother.  When Sorcha tracks him down with the intent of retrieving the dagger and killing him, he recognizes her as his mate who he believes died 80 years ago.  Although he is confused, he is sure Sorcha is the love he lost long ago.  The problem is, Sorcha has no memory of him and intends to fulfill her duty as a huntress by retrieving the dagger, even though she feels inexplicably drawn to him.Primal Attraction is a fantastic love story.  I loved that although it seemed impossible, Cale knew Sorcha was his mate even though he had seen her die 80 years before.  He didn't doubt for a minute that she was his fated love and he would do anything to help her remember what they once had.  Cale is a special kind of sexy in that he processes just enough of the alpha male dominance that makes your toes curl but he knows just when to pull back as well.  I also liked that he respects Sorcha's dominant streak and at times seems turned on by it.The only thing I'd say this story was lacking in was action.  Although there were a couple of small fight scenes, the one main fight scene was only referred to and the reader is completely excluded from it.  I got the impression that it was a grand scene having to do with the reason Cale stole the dagger but the story only picks up after the fight a month later.  It just felt like something was missing.Although Sorcha has no memory of Cale it seems her heart and soul remember quite well and her body reacts to him accordingly. Their romantic chemistry is at times breath taking. Cale's desire to claim his mate in every possible way and Sorcha's conflicted feelings for Cale complicated by her duty as a huntress creates fantastic sexual tension which leads to some very erotic love making.Primal Attraction is a wonderful paranormal romance with some interesting twists and turns.  Cale's unwavering dedication to his mate is touching and romantic and Socha's unexpected sacrifice nearly brought me to tears."
1038,4,"Even a book that is mediocre by Lolita Lopez standards is still a pretty doggone good book. As with other LL books, there is a bit of the dark side in this one. Dominant male who likes bondage, light punishment, etc... The premise is interesting with the heroine caught between a rock and a hard... Good read."
1039,5,"This is the story of Devin, a skittish diva who is running from love and Erik, the man hell bent on chasing her crazy behind until she admits she loves him and is ready to move their relationship to the next level. I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin, afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived, is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest, most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries!

1040,5,"Do you know you find a book that read once and you just have to read it again and again because it stands out so much and just keeps calling to you, this is what happens every time my eyes run past any of Dana Marie Bell's books.Ruby is such an interesting character; I think her sense of self preservation is kind of muted because when she gets something in her head it immediately comes out of her mouth, even when dealing with the bad guys. I loved when she told the Deranged Darling she had spinach between her teeth that was priceless and calling the vampire, Jaden &#34;Bunnicula&#34;. Leo will have his work cut out for him trying to keep her out of trouble.I felt so bad for poor Jaden feeling like he is so alone because the two people he loves most turn out to be mates :(The characters in this book are larger than life and hook you right in from the very beginning.  Even though this was the fourth time I have read this book I was still annoyed every time I had to put it down and now I feel the urge to go read the next book in the series again."
1041,5,"ok so the reason I gave this book 4.5 stars, was because it was too short... Otherwise  this story was FREAKING HOT!! but, BEWARE if you are not into menage, or guy on guy then this book might just not be the one you want to read. Its super steamy and sexy and blew me away with the sex scenes. I think this  author really did a great job on writing this story. It was extremely creative, and who would have thought a game like that would bring them together. This book was super cute, In the beginning Charlie didn't realize how she felt about the men who have been in her life for many years, they scared away the men she brought home, interrogated them whenever she brought dates to dinner, and it just never occurred to her that they might all have feelings for her. one of the guys she has a strong connection to his name is Simon and he seems like he has always been in love with her. Her and Simon have the strongest connection compared to the other two men. Then there is Rafael and Eric, and they both have liked each other (the men) and they just never hooked up because they didn't want to ruin what they had with Charlie. Until this cruise happened, they never tried anything with each other, and when it finally happens and they take chances and risks, Charlie gets scared and runs away. But will she realize that she has wanted them all along? Will they realize that she was the connection to all of them being able to love each other? READ this book and find out, i promise you wont regret it, it will make you HOTT!! make sure you have a fan handy!LOL"
1042,3,I liked the different spin on vampires. I enjoyed this and it reads very well. A fast pace and characters I came to care for and root for. It will be interesting to see where it goes from here as I see there more books in the series. This was entertaining and who can ask for more?
1043,4,"Destiny is a sensible kind of woman and when her grandmother tells her she is destined to meet her soul-mate she shrugs it off as silly nonsense.  However when she meets Reece the sexual chemistry between them is undeniable.  They quickly escalate their new friendship to a physical relationship and in doing so they make a connection on a completely different level, one that frightens them both and leaves Destiny to wonder if soul-mates really do exist.Eden Bradley knows how to heat up the pages in a hurry.  She creates sexual tension and love scenes that will get your heart racing.  But she also creates characters that are realistic and fun to read.  If you're looking for a quick, sexy read to warm you up, then Winter Solstice is just the ticket.  I enjoyed Ms. Bradley's style and look forward to more in this series as well as her other titles."
1044,2,"The author writes well, her wording was elegant, the characters were well defined and the setting/ worldview imaginative.The downloaded sample gave no hint of what was to come. One of the reviews implied sex scenes but did not indicate the graphic nature of the descriptions. I am not a puritan, but I don't enjoy extremely graphic descriptions and I prefer more storyline than sex. This is just simply not my kind of fantasy."

1046,4,"I have to admit that I enjoyed ""Thief"" far more than I expected, and it certainly isn't like another other mystery or sci-fi story I've ever read. It sucked me right in and all the way through to the end! I agree with other reviewers that it is of excellent quality.There were some typos and the like that were noticeable, but, unlike other books I've read, they didn't annoy me to the point that I had to get away from the book. It was hard to put down indeed! In fact, I just jacked up the font size on my Kindle and kept going as I got more and more tired.Now I have to go buy the author'sExecutive Lunch (A Sedona O'Hala Mystery)since the preview in ""Thief"" has sucked me into that one, too. Good thing I already have herSage: Tales from a Magical Kingdom, which is also previewed in ""Thief."""
1047,5,"The traumatic meeting of Emerald Sandford and Asher Wellingham, Duke of Carisbrook occurs five years before the story begins, when she's the 16-year-old member of her nobleman-turned-pirate father's crew and he's the 26-year-old captain of one of his merchant ships. Discovering she's female, Asher refuses to fight her, because, even when beseiged by pirates, a gentleman never harms a lady.  Emerald repays him by knocking him overboard and out of harm's way, not knowing this will make Asher the pirates' captive. It eventually loses him the use of his right hand and his brother his sight. Asher escapes and returns to wipe out the stronghold and kill her father and this is where the story begins. Emerald follows him to England. It isn't for revenge but to retrieve her father's walking stick he took because inside it is the map to a treasure she can use to pay off Beau Sandford's debts and free herself from the past.Using her father's family name and right to a title, Emerald becomes Lady Emma Seaton. Naturally Asher's suspicious of her and intrigued because of her obvious lies and uneasiness in high society. Of course they fall in love but this is more an in-depth study of the main characters attitudes than a mere will-they/won't-they love story. Asher is bound by duty and honor...and extreme guilt. His wife died while he was seeking his revenge, his brother was blinded during his rescue. He returns to his family home a widower, disabled in body, but more disabled in spirit, blaming himself for the tragedies occurring during his own travail. Emerald meanwhile sees herself as the cause. If she hadn't knocked him overboard, none of this would've happened.  Still pursuing her hunt for the walking stick, she believes the only way she can repay Asher for the misery she  has caused is to become his mistress and give him back  the love he lost and remove his grief over his brother's condition.It's an interesting story and an entertaining one, sensuous in spots, but staying away from the ballrooms and usual locales for such tales with most of the action taking place at Asher's estate. Flashbacks give reasons for everything that happens instead of playing them out in detail. Though this is the only James' novel I've read, I got the feeling there may be more on this family because of various hints given. If so, I'd like to read them,too.Harlequin Historical #888This novel was a gift to the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review."
1048,5,"we all remember our first loves.. not many of us thought it was the forever love of our lives.. we have go through high school thinking we have met the love of our lives till something happens and you can't stand to be in the same room with that person. Payton and Lizzie have that kind of love.. I couldn't put this book down.. he was SO mean to lizzie when he thought that he had to be.. but in the end sometimes you hurt the people/person that you love the most..i can't wait to see if there will be other books by this author.. if they are anything like ""the heart will lead you home"" i would buy it in a second.. you won't regret this book purchase.."

1050,3,"I picked this title up and breezed through it pretty quickly, not surprising at all of sixty pages.  This was a cute little shifter tale, and a good start to the series in-so-far-as it was able to establish both setting and future goals for our shifter society.  That said, I still would have liked to have seen more world building, and was quite annoyed with the author when there was a chance expand the readers understanding of the shifter society and where it would be heading in the future and the opportunity was passed over in favor of our hero not paying attention to what was being said.  I found this shortcut a tad bit sloppy/lazy.  Ms. Andrews did excel at incorporating the hot and steamy parts and building that into a romantic relationship and not just a casual fling; commendable in such a short word-count without pre-existing relationships.  The characters were likeable, and even the secondary characters were somewhat defined.  It made me interested enough that I might look into more books in this series."
1051,4,"Love this book, it was only 0.99 cents short story but good. I love the caracters, the story flow easy, perfect read if you are looking for something short to read in a day or two. I recoment this author."
1052,5,"Apocalypse meet vampires, I'm sure you two will get along great.  In this story humanity has really messed things up and is in a world of trouble that's all our own fault.  As if the end of the world wasn't enough though, now the vampires have decided that humanity is no longer organized enough to be any kind of a threat and come out in the open to conquer and enslave.  Humans are now cattle, drugged into submission, and constantly on tap to feed the vamps.  There is a glimmer of hope however, in the form of a small group of resistance fighters that have found ways to avoid the drugs and are now fighting back for real.I have to say this combination worked great for me.  It just makes sense that if vampires did exist and we all but wiped out technology and began isolating ourselves in ever smaller communities with little to no communication to the outside, then those vampires would see this as a great chance to take over with little to no risk.  And as happens here it would be simple for them.  The serum used afterward just makes sense, the vampires aren't stupid, they would come up with ways to control their food.  No aspect of the story seems unlikely at all, and the author does a great job of telling it.  If you like vampires, or end of the world scenario stories then I couldn't recommend this one highly enough, you will definitely enjoy it."
1053,5,"This was a different ""end of the world"" synopsis. No zombies, pandemic, or virus. You can guess- it is a fog. The  children grow up as young adults in this book, which I found wonderful! A refreshing read. You will see the endurance of the human spirit and can easily see what could happen in these circumstances. Not the ""fog"", but if any children were left to their own devises for a long period of time.Several people have made negative statements about a kid of 16 pairing with another, about age 27 years old. That would not be uncommon in this type of setting. The amount of people in this story are limited. Also, sexual desires often takes precedence over what would be considered normal. I never make comments of editing. I know any author is doing the best he can afford at the time."
1054,4,"This book was good. Not my typical kind of story, but I did enjoy it. It was a great story and kept my interest. I would recommend this book and will read more by this author again. Nice job :)"
1055,5,"As always when I start a new book I'm a little shaky. What will this book bring me? Well this book brought me laughs, tears, fears and a whole lot of good stuff! The love between Tess and Jaxon was awesome. This author brought me a window into magic. She showed me what love between a wizard and human would be and the trials they would have to go through. The anger the understanding and the not understanding that these two people would have to go through. The fighting and loss. I really liked this story and I'm glad the author could write magic!"

'Darius, I cannot go on with our wedding, I'm in love with someone else... I hope you can forgive us.'  The problem, the groom was already at the church.  When Darius searches for his brother to share the news, he can not be found, it is then Darius realizes who the 'us' is.  To escape the pain and embarrassment, Darius moves to New Zealand and fulfills his business dreams.  Now almost ten years later he is the proud owner of a fabulous vacation resort but, his personal dreams are still locked on Liz and his brother's heartless betrayal.Liz has had her share of heartache, and much regret over making the biggest mistake of her life.  But, there is a current issue that takes precedence over her past.  Someone close to her is in desperate need, and Darius is the only one who can help.  When she finds him, on his far-off, exotic island, she realizes Darius is no longer the dependable, high-school sweetheart she jilted, his demeanor is cold and he is burning with revenge.  In spite of his feelings, Darius agrees to help her but, he demands something in return; the honeymoon they never had.  But, Darius' revengeful demand and past heartaches are put on hold when he discovers the secret Liz has been hiding all these years.HIS PERFECT MATCH is a familiar story, but it is told with plausible candor, and with a storyline reminiscent of fine wine. The story is of a love that needed to be aged, so it could evolve into something rich, warm and wonderful.  Ms. Overton brought realness to the primary characters, as she reflected their growth and let them play out their true feelings.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ(tm) Reviewers"
1058,5,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long, long time.  The snarkiness, the genuineness of the characters, the writing are all just plain wonderful.  She describes someone as looking like ""Ichabod Crane's ugly brother.""  Even writing that makes me laugh.  Read this book, you won't regret it."
1059,4,"Keeping her ranch was utmost in Kyla's heart and mind. However, her ruthless stepbrother made life miserable for her and took personal liberties that made her life fearful. She sought the help of a Bounty Hunter,Jace,who managed to bring peace to the town and countryside where Kyla lived. It was a long arduous journey filled with death and destruction that brought Kyla back home and introduced Jace to the ranchers.  This is one of my favorite authors and I re-read her books often. However, the editing is poor.  I find mistakes once in awhile in kindle books and move on; in this book it was disturbing as there were many errors.  Ms. Harrington is a wonderful storyteller and since this book has been on kindle for quite some time, I would like to see her correct this book."
1060,4,"I never knew Harlequin had a teen series. Maybe it's new. In any case, I found this author's writing to be really good and wasn't disappointed that the book was so short, considering it's a prequel for her series. Plus, the book was free on my Kindle and I read it in one sitting. Even though it was meant for teens, I'll read the sequel myself and recommend it for my daughters. It had me hooked. Hey, a ton of people read Twilight, too!"
1061,5,So sense the brothers fell in love tell me how did everything worked out with there new pact along with their familys as well so where is part two only for the brothers?
1062,2,"Unfortunately did not like this book at all.  I found the plot to be dumb, and the writing was sub-par.  The ending was better than the first 3/4 of the book, but not worth the money paid.  Sorry Rhyannon!  Normally I love your books, but this one should have been scrapped."
1063,1,"Melina is a captain of a battle cruiser in the Alliance military and the destined mate (the author calls this gemate)to Wulf. Wulf is the captain of a battle cruiser in the Prime military and Melina's mate(gemat for the male version). They of course meet and have an instant bond which Melina struggles against while they fight off several alien enemies and a home grown rebel force.I am not a professional writer by any means but I think my summary was more interesting then the whole book. It started out decent and then became the story of Melina constantly fighting and putting herself at risk which resulted in her getting hurt and then Wulf would show up after the fact to growl and rage and fuss over her....it was stupid. In one scene Melina is bleeding profusely, she can barely move, and a traitor shows himself in a room full of able bodied Prime warriors, but it's Melina who has to get up and fight the guy! All the warriors stand and watch, including Wulf, I was laughing it was so ridiculous. This was the theme throughout the book and the sci-fi elements came off as spouted nonsense. Here I can do it too, we are entering Helium Prime with four battle cruisers on our tail bearing 3.2 light years.......seriously!The author can put together a semi-decent sentence all though she would get names mixed up sometimes and you would have to stop to make sure who she was referring to, but the plot and storyline were awful after a third of the way through. The main steamy scene was forgettable, the whole book came off boring and corny. I struggled to finish, checking repeatedly how much longer I had to go till I was done.I got this book for free otherwise I would have been mad that I wasted my money and not just my time. Don't waste yours!"
1064,5,"This book was a little hard for me to get into but once I did and finished it, I immediately went on-line to the kindle store and bought the second one.  The beginning is a little slow and it seems like it is going to be a normal crack the head zombie book but it is all that and more. There is a plan by the people that started the zombie outbreak and there are many twists and turns in the book. Buy this one and you will not be disappointed."
1065,5,I was thrilled when I stumbled upon this short series of books.  Only problem I found was I wanted more to read.  Wish there were more in the series.  I love these brothers.  It was well worth the $3 price I paid on them.  Instantly fell in love with the youngest brother and then the other 2 are hard to resist.  Have recommended to all my kindle owning paranormal reading friends.  Haven't heard a complaint yet.
1066,5,SOLANGE AND DANE WHAT A COUPLE; THE ROARKE MEN WHAT CAN A WOMAN SAY BUT THANK YOU. DEFINITELY READ THIS STORY.
1067,4,"Not a fan of short stories, but WOW this was def a good read. very hot and steamy. And god was she brave to be so forward my goodness i would never be able to do that, i guess ill settle for living that way through these kinds of books HA"
1068,5,I loved theses when the first came out I think they are one of my all time favorite series and always will be
1069,5,"Loved all of the first five books in this adventure.  Jaid Black really gets you involved in her paranormal world  of fantasy warriors however after reading the reviews of books 5.5 and six I stopped the series. I really wanted some closure on some of the main characters not expand upon book 2. Book six for the amount of reading I do, doesn't sound like the story is ending.  It is shame because up to this point I couldn't stop reading it."
1070,5,A very nice newspaper and very good writing. This is so fun! So good! I cannot buy it but I know that this will be a very great paper.
1071,5,"I always enjoy a great romance novel and Brenda Jackson never fails to deliver.  She brings just the right amount of spice to her books and they keep you wanting to read more, cant wait to get started on the next one."
1072,5,"I loved, loved, loved this book! The writing was awesome, as were the characters (I especially loved Noelle), the humor, and yes, the very hot smexy times! This was a fast paced short story that totally hit the spot for me. Despite a couple small hiccups that I'll get to in a minute, I cannot wait to read the other books in this series. Or anything else Maggie Casper might write! Awesome, awesome book. All around quick, fun and hot read that I recommend.So, let me get to those small hiccups that --ultimately-- prevented me from adding this one to my Favorites list. First is the lack of anything truly Christmas-y. Even the Mrs. Claus costume was only mentioned once and the rest of the time it was as if she was wearing everyday clothing. Personally, I felt that that part of the plot was pretty weak and could have been left off completely. Secondly, I never got why these characters loved each other. With Noelle it was never even brought up and with Cash his reasoning was shallow and very disappointing. Being an erotic romance I'm sure I don't need to spell it out. I did ease up a little based on the fact he works in a bar and is a man... not exactly the brightest bulb in the box in my opinion."
1073,5,"I'm glad I decided to start this new series and author for me. Love how the characters work well from the first to the second, without having to read, a page worth of back history, (C. Feehan). I'm hoping to be able to find the third e-book. Did not see at listed on my kindle choices, but now I have all the others in the were-series, and will be upset if I have to miss/skip a whole book."
1074,4,It is always fun to read a story where a child's Christmas wish comes true.  You could feel some of the heartache and personal pain.  Good read.
1075,5,"I am not a ""blogger"" type person...but I must say this an excellent way to go!  Always great choices in books and games, along with great tips!"
1076,4,"Like all Linda Howard's books, this is one of her best - MacKenzie series are all well-written with nice plot, engaging, and filled with family oriented characters. Maris Mackenzie is the only daughter and the youngest among Wolf's and Mary's children - she is sweet and like her father, also loved horses. Her marriage to a nice and wonderful man was something to remember - with the help of her cute niece who stole the whole show!"
1077,4,"This was a short, entertaining read. I don't know that I'd classify it as erotic but it is a steamy fantasy story. Dardanus is definitely an anti-hero and not exactly likeable in the beginning. Because of the short length of this story, it's hard to say much without giving away spoilers, but The Knife's Edge is a sensual read about Queen Nestra and Dardanus. While many in the kingdom seem to consider the Queen fragile and not deserving of the throne (Dardanus is one of those people at first), she's a woman looking to give up control in the bedroom, trust someone for once and have someone see her for herself and not her title. Even though the entire story is told from Dardanus' point of view, all that came across clearly which I think says a lot about Ms. Draven's storytelling ability. I was completely engrossed in this story and if this is an example of her writing, I will definitely be looking for more by her."
1078,5,"In Seven Days from Sunday, M.H. Sargent immediately brings you into the characters stories and vividly portrays their personalities. Sargent weaves the riveting stories together, going back and forth between scenes and character groups as you begin to see how they are related. It's a fantastic start of a great series that involves a team of CIA agents working undercover in the Middle East. I highly recommend the entire series. If you have any interest in Middle East issues, you'll be intrigued by this entire series."
1079,5,"I really enjoy the story of Ryan and Ginny....friends, co-workers, Dom/sub and lovers.  Mari Carr painted a wonderful picture of friends who finally succumb to the feelings that their friends have known about for years.  The added element of a Dom finding his submissive made the story even more enjoyable for me.This is definitely a book I would read again and again, especially when I craving for something sweet and spicy.  Looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
1080,5,"This is a short book, a start to a wonderful new series.  Nalini Singh once again brings a whole new idea to paranormal romance.  I loved ""Angel's Pawn"" and the moment I was finished reading it I bought #2, ""Angel's Blood.""  I'm very excited to read any and all future novels from this very talented author."
1081,5,Interesting storiesStudying these lives of the prophets gives insight into the difficulties of &#34;growing&#34; the early church and overcoming barriers
1082,5,This is the best story by this author I have read yet.  Very imaginative and very sexy as well.  Leaves you wanting more.
1083,3,"I've read a few lesbian seduction books. in terms of ""hot and bothered"": this was average at best. Their were four avg. stories."
1084,4,"This excursion into Middlemarch was my debut with Shelley Munro. Not sure how this shifter series has gone overlooked by me for so long.  However, now that I've made this discovery - I predict many return trips. The author did a remarkable job of creating an appealing group of characters. Both Emily and Saber have strong passionate personalities. Their story and romance built together plausibly - not rushed nor forced. Lucky for me there are already 11 more installments in this series waiting for me to read..."
1085,5,"""When the two of them finally act on their mutual desire, everything around them fades away in the face of the blazing heat. And though it may seem like it takes a while for the story to progress to that point, the pacing fits the overall story and keeps it moving from start to finish. I enjoyed everything about this story and am extremely satisfied with the ending."" - Karin"
1086,4,"A pleasant surprise for such an inexpensive book. Grab Killough-Walden's books cheap while you can, because I can't imagine they will be only $1.00 for much longer.Raven goes through enough of a journey in The Chosen Soul for 2 or 3 books. Although the plot does meander a bit, the pace is kept up with plenty of action and interesting characters. The ending leaves just enough unsettled to set the stage for a sequel, which I will definitely pick up when/if it comes out.Edited to add that book 2, Drake of Tanith, is released!  :-)"
1087,5,"I applaud Anderson for her ability to pack such in depth background into such a short story. I felt their pain and their passion and that's what I like to feel when I read a book.  I wish it had been longer!!!!  I was reluctant to have it end.....Believable, too."
1088,4,"4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this collection of short stories. They are all set in Parmas, a city where powerful sorcerers use spells and demons' parts to enhance technology or produce consumer goods. They live side by side with humans. We gather that sorcerers used to rule Parmas with an iron fist, but they had to restrain their powers and be more magnanimous to humans and demons alike. The Hell Cops - a law enforcement unity which apprehends loose demons or rogue sorcerers - help maintain the peace and order in the city. The three stories all takes place here, but the three different authors tell the story of one particular couple. I liked them all for different reasons.Next of Kin by Astrid Amara.Jay Yervant is a hell cop who comes from one of the richest families in Parmas. He is a loner because he is a sort of freak of nature even in a city like Parmas: he can't touch anybody because he literally burns. He doesn't fit in his family and he doesn't really fit in the police force either, because he could kill or maim people with a simple touch. One night he meets Brian Day, a young man working in a hospital, who casually touches him without being affected by Jay's condition. Brian is a special man: he is in Parmas looking for the father he's never known. He is young, handsome, naive. Jay is drawn to him for these reasons and because Brian seems to be involved in his investigation, but especially because he craves someone's touch.I think this story was the more complete in terms of world building and the most satisfying in terms of plot. I liked seeing how the younger and more naive character was also the sex expert, while the big tough cop was the more inexperienced. I wish this aspect of their interaction had been given more space.Red Sands by Nicole Kimberling.Michael Gold is a half demon working as a Professor. While returning from a trip between worlds, he ends up together with the corpse of a man. Initially Michael seems the killer and Argent is the hell cop who apprehends him. It doesn't take much to learn that the two of them have history and to clear Michael of all accusations, but still it seems someone near Michael must be the killer and the two investigate together.I liked very much Michael and it probably was so much more interesting than Argent that I didn't feel the connection between the two protagonists. I also think that the ending felt a bit rushed. The most interesting aspect was Michael's halfling nature that prevents him to fit completely in Parmas' world, since there is a sort of prejudice against demons. Argent and Michael should be enemies, but the attraction is too strong. I wish there had been more pages to develop this part of the story.Touching Sparks by Ginn Hale.James and Moran are my favorite couple. Moran, the hell cop, has known James since when he was a child, but little James, a photographer, now is all grown up and is helping Moran with an investigation. James has been attracted to Moran since forever, but he doesn't know how to approach the older and aloof man. Something happened to Moran in the past, we gather that he lost his lover in a traumatic way, and now he seems unable to reach out to someone else. He is attracted to James, he is concerned about his safety, but at the same time he takes no step to learn if James might be interested, he doesn't know if he should act on his attraction.I like stories where there is an age gap and there's the awkwardness of having known someone since when they were children. Moran seems afraid of spoiling James' innocence, as symbolized by his lean and beautiful body which Moran has to heal night after night. There is a very beautiful anticipation, that's why I would have preferred behind-door intimacy.I think all stories had a different degree of sweetness, which I wasn't expecting from these tough guys and in this setting, and they are all beautifully written. The fact that there are three different authors is not disruptive and even if each one of them had a different approach to the world and story, the quality is overall high."
1089,5,"I loved reading this book.  It was funny, sexy, and just fun to read.  It was well written and well proof read.  Some books are not!  The characters were well developed and story lines continued through the book."
1090,4,"I read this book cover to cover and couldn't help but visualise in my mind's eye the iconic Aliens 2 movie popping up at every turn... if thats your cup of tea, this is the book for you :)"
1091,5,"I love Eden's vampires!  It is always interesting g to see what twists each author has In the  vampire worlds they have created, and I have to say that these are some of my favorites. I love the connection between the 3 main characters, both physical and emotional.  Beautiful ending.  This book was a great intro to a new world. Can't wait to read more of this series!!"
1092,5,"What a very different slant the author comes from, clever. I had to laugh when this author bemoaned of his editing woes, I totally understand, that is why it's crucial to have outside editing help or who knows.....one may just start their own zombie outbreak. Haha. Good book. Very clever you are. A book worth attacking. Oh by the way, I HATED Nancy!!!!! You created her well."
1093,4,"This wound up being a much quicker read then I anticipated. I thought it a novel, but it's more of a short story to intro her Soul Screamers series. I read it in one sitting and very much enjoyed the read. I was very sympathetic to the protagonist within the first few pages and couldn't tear myself away from the book as I wanted to know what happened next, and next, and next. Great hook for the series."
1094,4,I got this book because it was free and I've just bought the second one because it was that interesting. It's well written and thankfully missing the grammatical and typographical errors so common to e-books these days. I liked the concept and the way the stories played out. I would recommend it.
1095,2,"I love Lora Leigh and have read most of her books and love them.  I have all her black op books and some of this series the bound hearts.  I have not read Surrender, so when I saw it was free was very excited.  I was very disappointed for a Lora Leigh book.  She normally has a great story line along with the hot sex in her books.  This book was mostly all sex, like other reviewers have said.  I did not like either one of the characters at all.  I did not feel the connection and love Cole & Tessa had that was suppose to be there from the beginning, it just lacked in so many ways.The sex was good, lots of BDSM but I thought a little poorly written.  I read a lot of this type of book so didn't see anything wrong with Cole tying Tess to the bed naked while she slept and ""forcing"" the sex to start when she awoke.  I have read a lot of Lora Leigh to know the sex in her books are out of the box and need people with a really open mind to read (I loved her Men of August series but got it lot of negative reviews).  The thing that I found the most wrong was Cole never had Tess pick a safe word.  When you have sexual situation where Cole is pushing and testing Tess's limits, like he explains to her, its pretty important to have a safe word, especially since he didn't listen to her saying NO, which is why you have a safe word.There was little storyline, not much keeping me to read to the ending, just lots of sex and the menage at the end.  I will continue reading Lora Leigh and this series (the books towards the middle & end of series are great) but I am really glad this was a free book."
1096,4,"This was an exciting thriller as promised, but it was rather disappointing in that it ended too soon for my satisfaction."
1097,5,This book is a great read-- better than I expected (I had never read anything else by this author) and I hope to read more. This is a great book if you enjoy epic fantasy and I am looking forward to reading the others.It's hard to discuss it without giving away the plot (I hate spoiler reviews) but it was an enjoyable read.FYI-- I bought this book for a dollar on Kindle-- what a bargain for great entertainment.
1098,5,"Dardanus and Queen Nestra' story told from Dardanus POV.  He is an Hero and the story although short, is well developed.  It would make a fantastic full size novel if developed as such."
1099,5,This was a really exciting story with wonderful characters to fall in love with! I can not wait for more!
1100,4,"Most of the time when I come across a book like this, I'm extremely wary of there being a ""cheesyness"" factor that will turn me off of the story. But this novel didn't do that for me! Read the rest of this review here: [....]"
1101,4,This was a pretty good read....It was rather quick also! I read it in a few hours...This coming of age tale was very realistic and captured a teens life in the hood.  The book showed how the choices you make eventually catch up to you. Great read and I cant wait to read book 2!
1102,4,Whenever I read a free book/novella most times it's way too short or just awful. I was lucky. I liked the originality of this story line and will read more by this author.
1103,5,R.G. Alexander has made it to my read again list with this series also. The characters and story draw you in and do not let go until the last word. The Wicked series will invoke all your emotional sensors. This is one of my favorites form this author.
1104,4,Very FAST! It was good and I felt bad that she had to go through that alone because he gave her a false name. I do like how their feelings never changed even though she is more cautious because of how he left and never got in touch. I do think he was faithful to her based on how he says his personal life suffered majorly because he was a workaholic and how every moment that he had away from work was filled with thinking of her. She was faithful to him because she had a son and never dated. I like when the hero and heroine only wants the other especially in this book because they both knew they had a once in a lifetime spark with the other. It was cute and fun and I was happy that he took the blame for them being apart and did not try to give blame to her for keeping his son from him like so many other heroes do even if the heroine did not know his real name.
1105,1,And it still wasted precious time out of my life. As the other review stated the heroine was not someone I would ever like and there wasn't enough character building in either person. The hero is a jerk yet they can't get enough of each other. The writing was amateur at best. The story could have been good if the writing was better and the background more solid. A waste of time and electronic services.
1106,4,"What a sweet little story. The virgin meets the wild child. The sex was hot. There's not a lot of emotional depth here but still a cute story with a lot of of sex,"
1107,4,"Three college friends tackle the adult world. MJ pursues a graduate degree at an unnamed British university and finds herself pursued by several men; Claudia follows her boyfriend to his new job in the Midwest and tries to make it as a writer; Sophie hates her advertising dream job and finds a new and unexpected career.I borrowed this book from another Kindle owner through the Lendle.me website. The three separate storylines are confusing at times, and it's just unbelievable that all three young women have men dripping off them. But many of the problems they face are similar to problems that my own twenty-something children are facing, so I didn't have any problem believing the rest of the book, and the stories kept me reading. Kindle formatting was okay. The book title was okay although not uniquely appropriate."
1108,3,"Star Wars: Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice, by John Jackson MillerAs I've said before, normally I don't care for short stories. But I make exceptions sometimes, and how could I pass up a Star Wars short story?""Precipice"" is an accompaniment to the new Star Wars series Fate of the Jedi, and tells how the missing Sith tribe landed on Kesh. The short story series also provides a few clues for Paul S. Kemp's ""Star Wars: Crosscurrent.""Omen, a Sith ship full of Lignan crystals crashes onto the planet Kesh. The survivors of the crash are stranded on the planet, with no way to contact their Sith masters or fly off Kesh.""Precipice"" has a Star Wars feel, and I liked the main character, Yaru Korsin. He's a captain in the vein of Han Solo: cocky, sarcastic, self-assured. But he also has the ability to use the Force. And while a Sith, he is disgusted when some of the survivors start fighting amongst themselves, as the dark Force users are wont to do.And that's about where ""Precipice"" finishes. It's a pretty good story, and I'm looking forward to reading the others in the series.3/5."
1109,5,"This book is amazing.  I loved the characters in this book. I especially liked the fact that this story is being told from two different points of view; the Sheriff, Dove Conelly, and one of the victims, Tessa Bradley. This book is a fast paced read. You get sucked in immediately. There is so much going on in this story, but I found it incredibly easy to follow. The ending of this book took me totally by surprise. Usually, I have an idea ""who done it"", but not this time. Author Rebecca Foster is an amazing story teller. If you enjoy thrillers, you definite need to pick this book up.*I received a complimentary of this book as a courtesy in exchange for my review."
1110,4,"Ann and her half-Arab boyfriend, Peter, go to Europe to explore and Ann is the typical college student...in love, alternating between deep feelings and superficiality, and very self-involved.  Her world and, in turn, the rest of the world starts to crack apart, when they both meet a fun Dutch couple and stay the night.  Waking, they find their guests butchered and then...Peter coolly tells her to touch nothing and leave.  They flee and soon Ann comes to believe she may not know her lover as well as she thought.  Could he be an underground Muslim extremist?  The Dutch assassinations start the long slide to religious war.  Some of the premises are very hard to buy....that Ann was not a ""person of interest"" due to her relationship with Peter, relentlessly interviewed and hounded, that the Muslims have infiltrated US culture and are preparing the downfall of the US.  Yet the suspense of finding out where and what has happened to Peter following his arrest and disappearance, keep up the interest.  The ending, well, can't say I believe it based on the character development. Overall entertaining read, but an alert, the politics, although fictional, may be offensive to some readers."
1111,3,"This was a short sexy story about a woman who finds love when she's out seeking revenge. I loved a lot about it. It was hot. It was sweet how quickly people's feelings changed. Unfortunately, it also stretched beyond the believable with how quickly those feelings changed.In a span of a week, a complete alpha man goes from bachelorhood to being deeply in love and willing to wait years for the woman of his dreams. A woman who has stewed over being wronged for years allows herself to develop affections for the man who wronged her.It's a nice story. It's also a bit ridiculous."
1112,3,The story starts strong but then turns predictable. There are much better shifter novels out there. I think it is over priced for the amount of content.
1113,5,"Loved it loved it. I was not sure where this book was going at first but when Mikhail went to claim Alya and she took off running and jumped down those flights of stairs barefoot I was hooked.This book was an energetic, humorous romance with powerful vampires and one bad ass chick that was so awesome. I loved it loved it, especially the end. (Note to writer: Find a way to offer an update. Maybe you can pick up a year later and the family has to fight some other vamps for the New York territory. I need a fourth book)"
1114,4,Wine drinking vampires- start of a new series with vamps and there one true mates- a great  start to a new series
1115,5,I love this book. The story is so good and keeps you interested from the beginning.  Heather Killough-Walden is a wonderful author.
1116,4,Lindsey is tired of being used by men so she swears off them until she meets Brad. Lindsey was offed a position to renovate a room for sex in a hotel. She has no limits on what she can do with the room. Lindsey is ready to create her ultimate fantasy and Brad is just the man to help her. He is hired to help with the construction portion of the room but one look at Lindsey and he would like to be renovating other things as well like her and him together. Brad has his own insecurities about woman and most people in general he has big dreams that he has never gotten any backing in. This is a great book to read about an in charge woman giving up control to a man who doesn't usually take it because he is not sure if he will be rejected. The are a great pare that burn up the pages and learn that if you open up just a little then true love an truly find you.
1117,5,Both primary and secondary characters ring true through Danes usual intelligent yet accessible dialog. Certainly worth the time for fans of the genre.
1118,4,"I love historical fantasy, but seeing as how this was a short story, I really couldn't get into it all that well. What I did read was wonderful!"
1119,4,This was quite enjoyable.I haven't yet read any of the repairman Jack stories from this author but I plan to.This does allude to a few bits of back story but it can still be enjoyed as a complete story in itself.
1120,3,"I've read almost all the Black Dagger Brotherhood in the paperback form and they held me breathless, start to finish.  This one fell short in my estimation."

I want to have a beer with Mr. Tangerine.  And the cover?  What's wrong with the cover?  It's a beach, get it?  I would have paid $4.99 and not been disappointed.I don't understand what everyone wanted at the end?  Some big confrontation with the mine setter?  A shootout that ends in the death of the evil doer.  C'mon people, what's wrong with changing it up?  A little variety; an odd twist."

1123,5,"Plot/Storyline: 5 StarsIf you enjoy romance along with a twist on a classic tale, you won't go wrong with this modern-day interpretation of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Daphne, a young woman who has lost her life before her time, must help Nathaniel, a Scrooge-like businessman, find his Christmas spirit.Most of the story takes place in Nathaniel's office. Daphne uses various accoutrements to play the parts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. In between these visions, Nathaniel and Daphne fall in love. However, they can't be together because Daphne only has a few hours in her current body, then must choose another.There was a relative of Nathaniel who is the ""Tiny Tim"" of this story, but I can't tell more so that it can remain a surprise.  The Bob Cratchitt of this story is a humorous revelation.My only complaint about the book was the rather long, detailed sex scene in the middle. The story was too cute and family friendly to contain it. There was a lot of innuendo leading up to it, so it wasn't the act that surprised so much as the several pages of detail in which it was described. However, I do know that it is expected in a lot of romances, so I won't take any points off for it.Whenever I read Dickens' A Christmas Carol, or see a movie based on it, I always, always cry at the end when Scrooge goes around giving everyone presents. This novel had the same effect on me. I think, in some ways, it tugged even harder on the heart strings because of some complete strangers that Nathaniel finds out about.The ending? Well, all I can say is, ""God bless us, every one.""Characters: 5 StarsNathaniel was a great Scrooge. He reminded me more of Bill Murray in Scrooged than the one created by Dickens. All of the scenes from Christmases past and present provided plenty of insight to give his character depth and understanding from the reader.Daphne was less well developed, but equally interesting. Most important, the two characters played well off of each other. There was a good mix of chemistry for a believable love affair.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe writing style was pretty straightforward without a lot of bells and whistles, i.e. long, drawn-out descriptions. It made for a fun, easy read, which is just what I want in a holiday novel. The dialogue was exceptionally well done, especially for a romance. One of my turn-offs in romance novels is the cheesy things the characters say to each other. That wasn't found here. Sure, there was some lovey-dovey stuff said, but it didn't go off the deep end into abject corniness."

He yearns to make her the love of his life and the mother of his children.  When he finds out she is moving back to town, his heart jumps for joy, all the while knowing that she probably won't even look at a man like him.Veronica Abbott has to get out from under her parents control, even though she has been married and widowed.  Moving back to her hometown, she decides to open a romance shop.  Taking a basket to the local fire department as a thank you for saving her childhood home from burning down, Veronica walks into the locker room and comes face to face with Dean Wolcott; the object of her secret teenage crush.  Veronica then proceeds to show him just how much she has missed him and is attracted to him.Dean wants Veronica with every ounce of his being.  He doesn't want to be her part time lover, he wants to be the love of her life forever.  He promises to give her time but is unsure if a girl like her will ever love him.Caught Off Guard was a naughty look at two people whose childhood crushes were still alive and strong years later.  I fell in love with Dean completely and absolutely because his intentions were so loving and so honorable.  I found myself wincing with Veronica's mannerisms and blatant sexuality, but after realizing how she wanted to finally be free from being controlled, I could see where she was coming from.  Caught Off Guard by Tonya Ramagos was a delightful read. I liked the plot and love when true love prevails!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"

1127,5,"Kate Harper needs a place to stay while going through a divorce from her philandering husband. She has suffered in more ways than one in her loveless marriage and she just needs time and space to regroup and carrying on. She prefers life in the country to the city and needs to rebuild her self-esteem as she continues her secret writing career.Rick McAllister, a bachelor DEA agent, agrees to let Kate housesit for him and his partner as no one else seems to want the job. He did have one stipulation though and that was that she had to take care of their big, scary dog too. Kate is afraid of dogs, but her needs far outweigh her fear and she takes on the job.Kiss me, Kate was my first foray into Mari Carr's work and if this is an example of what this author can produce it won't be my last. I liked that the characters took the time to build a relationship using the technology of today instead of jumping on each other at the first opportunity. The development and change of her character was believable as she lets her inner self out instead of being a doormat trying to live up to other people's expectations. It was also nice to see that the self-assured Rick McAllister has some fears about Kate liking him for whom he truly is and being able to handle the games he likes to play because he would certainly like to experience them with her. Some of the scenes seemed so lifelike and I really enjoyed the phone conversation between Rick and Kate after her divorce, it seemed like it was a real phone call taking place. Kate had an endearing quality of letting things fly out of her mouth even when she was muttering them and Rick was truly that white knight that charges into the rescue just when you think it may be too late. I liked that Kiss me, Kate had Kate becoming more self-confident before exploring her wanton side with Rick and ceding control to him. I also enjoyed that they took things slow in the bedroom before jumping in feet first. Kiss me, Kate was truly an enjoyable read and I'm glad I took the time to read this author.Vanessa for Joyfully Reviewed"
1128,5,"There are a bazillion cookbooks out there.  If I had to choose just ONE, this is it.I owned a restaurant for 15 years, and Cooks is the one source of consistent inspiration that I have found.What separates Cooks from all the rest is their discussion of what does NOT work in the recipe.  Things they tried and why they were not happy with the results.After a while you feel like you are a part of their test kitchen team and you know what to suggest and why.  Instead of ""cook booking"" your way through your kitchen life, you actually begin to internalize kitchen strategies.This book will not only help you with some fun recipes, it will make you a better cook.  Now THAT's icing on the cake!"
1129,3,I have to agree with the other reviewers; this book was perking along nicely and it just kinda stopped. I also really had to laugh at the fact that it supposedly takes place at a Tahoe campgound. They would have been kicked out after the first night for making too much noise!
1130,3,"So after reading CONCRETE UNDERGROUND, which I liked even though I didn't quite know what was going on when it was all done, I decided to try this story.  It started off well, with a scene that pulled me in and made me want to keep going.And it was okay.  There were some issues, similar to my experience with CONCRETE UNDERGROUND, where in the end, I wasn't sure what was the truth of the situation.  Likewise with this book.  Add to the experience that I just didn't think the story stayed as strong and compelling as CU was for the most part, and I didn't like many of the characters.  There were parts where the formatting and proofreading weren't so good and at least one place where the character who is gagged suddenly starts speaking without having the gag removed.  That pulled me out of the story completely.I wouldn't completely diss the book, but I can't say I would rate it higher than 3 stars due to its flaws."

They are about finding true happiness and dealing with family and issues that happen within families.  Each sibling gets their own story.Cal is the oldest brother; he hires his ex-wife Penny to re-vamp the family's flagship restaurant that used to be the pride of the family and now is on the edge of closure. Penny is a popular new and upcoming chef in the area but does not have enough money to start her own restaurant or start a family (even if it is on her own) she desires. She accepts Cal's offer in exchange, she has a few stipulations of her own. This story is about second chances, very sweet.Walker is the third brother and an ex-marine.  He leaves the military after his experience at war and comes home with ""baggage"" and needs to adjust to his new life.  His story is about adjusting, learning to trust others and allowing others to love him.Reid is the middle brother.  He was an ex-athlete who retired too early because of an injury.  He is used to his playboy ways and finds himself running the family owned sports bar.  He has problems with commitment as well as maintaining relationships that last longer than one night.  He hires Lori to take care of his grandmother.  Lori is the first woman who did not throw herself at him, so he is intrigued by her.I really enjoyed this bundle.  It was great to see how the story of this family, the drama around it, the romances and issues continued from one book to the other, and everything flowed really well.  It is worth reading. I couldn't stop reading. Pick yourself the last book as well to complete the series.  The last one is about Dani, their youngest sister."

One flaw I see is that they are from the same planet and there are other people from their planet on board; why aren't the others changing?

1136,5,"I read What a Catch before this one and loved it, so I figured I'd give Pitcher Perfect a try because I loved Allie and Alex's friendship in What a Catch. They totally understand each other and I love reading the dialogue between the two of them.I loved this book, but I have to say I enjoyed What a Catch more. I love the relationship that Allie and Alex share better in it and I think Scott is her soul mate. I also felt it was like the author was trying to hurry up and end the book. I found the end sort of happened pretty sudden. I would have enjoyed a little more to the ending, it feels like I didn't get the closure that I did in What a Catch."

1138,5,"Lovely! I finished this book with a lonely tear running down my face, perfect!James, the narrator, is a hardened man. Of all the things he had in his life, only the love for books has remained. When he meets Sedge, James is a paycheck away from the street. To survive he needs to buy the book for his sleazy client, but first his pride and then his attraction for Sedge get in the way. It's James himself that recognizes that he is not probably a model of integrity, but he acts with his own code of honesty and, even when he does wrong, he means well. What I appreciated more is that he's maybe depressed, but he's never bitter.Sedge is giving. He's also single-minded, outspoken and blunt, and a generous lover. The reasons why he's selling the book are altruistic and speak of a man of great ideals.When these two men meet and collide, what comes out is an unstable relationship that kept me turning the pages to see what good might come from such unpromising premises. We are in James' head all the time, so maybe that's the reason why he always seems so contained and closed and tightly wound. Sedge on the contrary seems always to projects himself to the outside. They couldn't be more different.The opposite backgrounds of the two main characters made them even more endearing and James' humor, a trademark of Josh Lanyon's narrators, made me highlight a few paragraphs. There's a masterly drawn encounter with an ocelot that is revealing of both James' practical disposition and Sedge's helping nature. The ending is full of possibilities.I recommend this book to everyone, because it leaves you with a warm and happy feeling."
1139,3,"A very short story; I guess it's a novella but I didn't think it would be.  Also, not enough story, mostly sexual encounters - but then, it's that genre.  They're not great for story.Cord Daily has loved and wanted Cait Culver as long as he can remember, but her father threatened him then sent her to Paris for two years.  Now, she's back - and Cord takes the opportunity, with his cousin Dalton, to have a night with her.  He never knew that she wanted him, too.

1142,3,"I'm not much of a romance fan, but this story sounded like just the thing to cleanse my literary palate for the new year. The fact that it's relatively short and just 99 cents definitely helped. But frankly, I was a little disappointed.First, the other reviewer's comment about the formatting for Kindle was spot on. Bizarre characters, strange indenting, chapter titles that start at the bottom of a page, typos - it needs some cleaning up. It's very distracting when you're trying to get into a story. That said, the formatting in no way influenced my rating.The Haircut is a wonderful concept but the execution could have been better. The back and forth in the barber shop went on *forever* using the same words and phrases. I understand that the barber was conflicted about the girl's request. I understand the girl wanted it done ""like the boy's haircut."" But the characters just kept saying the exact same thing. I enjoy scenes of conflict but this one just got tedious.As I said, I don't read romances so perhaps this is a common device, but the repetition throughout seemed to be included to simply fill space. It was so distracting and frustrating, in fact, that I simply stopped reading about 60% in. I mean, the ending isn't any secret, is it?So why did I give it three stars? It's a lovely story, and I really enjoyed learning a little about Misha. I also think tightening it up by about a third would make this a very readable little gem.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"
1143,5,"Dr. Thorndyke has remained something of a hidden treasure, known only by mystery freaks who sought the out-of-print books by his creator, R.Austin Freeman in the now almost mythical musty, dusty used bookshops of (it seems like) only a few years ago.But that has all changed. In recent years, Freeman's works began appearing in trade pb editions on amazon. They were a good deal at around $6.00 apiece. So, shaking the dust from my hair, I bought a bunch of them. I should have waited till I got a kindle last Christmas.To illustrate my point, the ebook I am now recommending to you costs $.99. It consists of 3 novels and a short story collection. I probably paid $35-$40 (including shipping) I guess. Something you can get on kindle now for less than $1.00.But forget the money for now. Here is your chance to get turned on to perhaps the greatest detective of all time. Don't shout ""heresy"" yet, Holmesians. I'm a great fan of the world's first consulting detective too.

1146,4,"This was a sweet and charming adult fairy tale, not the usual type of book for me to read.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much.  The characters were well-developed for a short novel, and Misha, the angel, provided a message for us all to live by.  I think that ""thorns to feathers"" may always remain in my mind.  Although I kept thinking of this book as a romantic fairy tale, it made me smile, it made me sad at times, and it took my mind away to a place I enjoyed. I was able to get lost in it.  Overall, it was a heartwarming love story with a ""happily ever after"" ending.  If not for various formatting issues and grammatical/missing word errors, I would have given it five stars.  I read the author's other book, New Coastal Times, which was very good as well and did earn a five star rating from me.  I hope she writes more books soon, and I will definitely read them.  In my opinion, Donna Callea is one of the best independent authors."
1147,4,"I've been really curious about this book and had it on my TBR list for a while, but it wasn't until I read Mariya's review that I was coerced into buying the book... and unholy hell what a read!!I don't read many M/M Romance books, but it's not because I don't like, oh believe me, I do! I just haven't found the right book, series, or author to drag me (willingly of course ;) into the M/M world. But I think Evangeline just did that for me.Plot wise, Str8te Boys isn't much of a read, but Maverick and Duke were so entertaining I honestly could care less what they did outside that apartment. I'm double daring these hotties to keep rubbing their big, muscular bodies and c***s to one another while making out with lust-filled hunger until they come on each other!Unholy hell... where are my ice buckets?!!!I thought the whole concept for ""gay chicken"" was ridiculous, especially considering that no straight man in his right mind would let another man touch his junk. But here's where thngs get interesting, because Duke and Mav have taken their ""game"" to extreme possibilities. I love that these guys are jocks. They've been playing in the same soccer team for the past four years (plus in my book, I love soccer players ;)), and they've been roomies and bff's since their freshmen year of college. Str8te Boys is told from Maverick's POV, and it's interesting because as ""uncomfortable"" as he gets when Dukes talks guy on guy action, he still allows him to get close. To play with his c*** to kiss, to lick... and so many other sinfully delicious things.Duke is suppose to be straight as well, according to Mav, but it didn't take long for me to begin to question these guys' sexual orientation, and then things really take off when Duke and Mav go to a photo shoot together. Basically a porn site for gay men with straight looking ones.The more Duke and Mav's relationship progresses, the more Mav begins to question his nature. Everything seems perfect for the two until a late night trip to the drugstore ends with Duke's heart being broken. Now, Mav must come to terms with who he truly is, or risk losing not only his best friend, but his heart as well.Like I said, the idea of ""Gay Chicken"" for me was ridiculous, but so very clever at the same time. Both Mav and Duke were great characters. I would have loved seeing some soccer action, and them interacting outside of each other. But the scenes were so delicious between these two I'll happily shut up as long as I get front row seats and touch action! *Rawr* ;) I'll be sticking to Evangeline Anderson for more sinfulness from now on."

1150,5,"I sort of have this habit of going on the hunt for Fairy Tales retold in a `erotic' or `romance' fashion. A what if, or even a sequel to the stories that we grew up with as children. So many times I have been disappointed, even annoyed at how they spun the tail, either making the Princesses slutty or really unlikable.However, this story did none of that. Cinderella unmasked is a sequel to the Cinderella story and boy oh boy does it deliver! I loved this whole story, I loved all the plot turns, I thought each sex scene was more and more sexy. I want to think of the Princesses as adults because they are. When they first get married you are disillusioned by the great Disney Princess image that is tossed at you as a young girl. But if you are like me when you grow up and see that scene with Cinderella and Charming driving off and kissing in the window don't you want to know what's going down at the honeymoon?This book is a great read, it gives more life to a beloved Fairy Tale and makes Cinderella appear more strong and independent rather than someone to walk all over. It even had a touch of some BDSM hints in it, trust me Sebastian will make an incredible Dom!"

1152,5,"When I first started reading M/M, I purposely avoided ""cowboy romances"" because they seemed clich&eacute;.  However, I am quickly finding they can be quite good and my opinion has changed.  I love the Cattle Valley series by Carol Lynne, so when I saw this novella from TA Chase (who I have read and enjoyed before) I went for it.The story is a fairly straightforward romance.  Tyler and JT are twins, and Tyler has always been the follower, taking care of JT on the rodeo circuit.  Until he finally decides he needs a life of his own, possibly with the handsome horse breeder Ren, that he can't get out of his heart.  There is angst in the story (JT having slept with said horse breeder simply b/c Tyler wanted him!) but it is nothing heartrending and easily overcome by the couple - as it should be in a novella that doesn't have the time or scope to expand.  The sex (I know you romance junkies are wondering) was excellent, better than I find in most short stories/novellas.  Chase throws a bit of kink into the mix, so it's not vanilla, but it is also far from BDSM.  A little bondage and some spanking heat the sex up very satisfyingly without tipping into uncomfortable.  I could easily reread this story again.A couple things did annoy me, such as Tyler constantly referring to Ren as ""the older man"" and the somewhat abrupt ending.  There was the requisite HEA, but a couple more paragraphs would have ended it more smoothly. Overall though, it was a very good story and I actually hope there'll be a sequel with JT."
1153,3,"This one is a really hard one to rate. I will say it now holds the record for the book that kept me up the latest ( three thirty in the morning for heaven's sake! I just couldn't put it down.) The suspense and mystery parts of the story were SO GOOD but the romance and overall moral of the story was SO frustrating!There were really only two problems (ok, the writing wasn't top notch in places but that can be over looked), the first is concerning the romance between Jack and Bella. Jack is a hired assassin who has been in love with Bella for 10 years, she is in love with him also but they have kept their relationship on the best friend level because of his profession. When things blow apart and they find themselves on the run and fighting for their (and their loved ones) lives, their relationship takes a major turn bringing all the feelings to the forefront. Jack has been holding out in a big way, however, and Bella starts to uncover all the lies and deceit he has been employing against her (in order to ""protect"" her). At least 5 or 6 times the topic is brought up with both the characters stating they will need to discuss and work these problems out between them. Jack must explain his reasons to Bella before she can ever trust him again. With all the action, however, these HUGE issues never get resolved, they have been the elephant in the room through half the stinking book and it NEVER HAPPENS! They just smile and walk off into the sunset together. AGH!!!!The other problem is probably personal. The killer for hire concept with the killer, who murders whoever he's hired to just for the big money, and with no remorse whatsoever, being the ""hero""- along with the contradictory plot where he is saving the son who's family have been assassinated by he and his associates just doesn't sit well. If there had been any redemption or remorse or change in attitude it would have worked for me. As it was, all good and bad just became a very dark gray. All were bad, the ones you root for are getting paid to kill indiscriminately, the ones you want to lose are also getting paid to kill indiscriminately, they're just trying to kill the ones we're rooting for. In the end, even the heroine goes to the dark side. Ick"
1154,4,"What I really like about this book is that the time frame spans months rather than just days. The whole development of the relationship between Max and Ryan is believable and they don't just hop into bed right away. The story was really well balanced for what I consider Erotica; yes there is lots of graphic sex but I don't feel that it was crammed down my throat or the only focus in the story. What I didn't like is how the antagonist of the story was so predictable and how a""security expert"" was being duped throughout the book. However, at least there was a plot going on behind just the relationship. There were some editing flaws that I found, but that seems to be common ground now a days and this book isn't nearly as bad in that department as some of the others that I have read recently.Overall this was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it."
1155,4,"This book was really good I wasn't expecting it.  I picked it up as quick read because one of my favorite author was releasing a new book the following day and so I read this one in the mean time.  The story was short, sweet and to the point I find myself reading all three books in like a day and the half."
1156,5,"Good read and an easy one. The character has both depth and flaws and is believable. The only fault I found to my thinking is that as important as Bonita became to him, and adding to that the fact she helped solve the case there is no further mention of her at all. I would have thought that the time he spent at Anne Rundles would have included time spent with her also. Perhaps she will turn up again in a future book."
1157,5,This book looks like a good start to a exciting series. Never ending excitement along with never ending murders. I am looking forward to the next book.

1160,4,"This book contains 3 short stories and an intro to get to know the two main characters, Wistril and his assistant Kern.  Wistril seems to be a pretty powerful wizard who has taken an very strict oath on non violence.  No matter the situation he cannot use magic to harm others.  This leads him to have some very creative solutions to problems that most wizards would solve with a simple fireball or lightning bolt.The interaction between Wistril and his assistant is always a source of amusement with Kern having no idea what Wistril is actually up to most of the time.  I will agree with another reviewer and say that I would have liked to get to know the characters a bit better to enjoy the stories more.This is the first book I have read by Mr. Tuttle and I can say that for sure I will be looking into more."
1161,5,"A different approach to a story involving a wrong side of the tracks girl who falls for a right side of the track boy but ends up married to his father, who is killed and the whole town hates her for the marriage and the death of the older man.What I thought happened in the back story didn't really come to fruition - just another story and I didn't really see it coming.  I enjoyed this book and wished there had been a little more tenderness with the heroine by the hero but there was a least a HEA for them regardless.My personal star and hotness rating is....&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;"
1162,4,"Fans of the ""with"" series should recognise the overall wold in this short story.  While this could be read as an unofficial prequel to the series, as these characters are mentioned briefly (though not by name) in Without Reservations, if you are unfamiliar with these novels I would read it after the first full novel.  I enjoyed this one and didn't find Laine irritating like some others did; not everyone can be perfect and it was a nice change from some other shorts I've read.  If you enjoy the series you'll probably like this addition to it as well, I did."
1163,3,An enjoyable read. I bought into the setting and had a thoroughly good time with this book.
1164,1,"I'm only reviewing this book, more accurately a story, to counter the overly positive ones it has received.  Otherwise I wouldn't even go to the trouble. I bought this because the plot seemed interesting--ancient vampire who has been disturbed by a young woman buying and moving in the old farmhouse over his lair.  It had promise--promise that the author couldn't fulfill.The book was written as if the author had a formula to write by: Introduce main characters, immediately have them have dream sex, then have male lead tell her that she is his one, and BTW he's a vampire and then have sex for the rest of the story.  No building up of the plot or tension between characters which lead to any type of climax (non-sexual type) and resolution.  The only vaguely dramatic scene happens off the pages--we see right before and after.  At least I know not to buy any more of her books."
1165,3,"You can just tell from the cover of the book that this is going to be a story of sex, sex and more sex.  It was free from Amazon at the time that I downloaded it.  If you are looking for something with a little bit of naughty, then this book is for you."
1166,5,"Virgin Seeks Bad-Ass Boy is hot, hot, hot! I read it while on the exercise bike at the gym. The hotter it got, the faster I pedaled. Ms. Kerce has a talent for writing emotion-packed stories. Alice is charming and sweet and anxious to lose her virgiity. Caleb starts off as the classic bad boy, but Ms. Kerce shows us his tender side which makes this story so sweet while it was incredibly hot. The sex was Wow! but it was the emotion between the characters that really makes this story. It's a hot, beautiful love story. I highly recommend it."
1167,5,Easy read but kept my attention and I kept wanting to read more to see what was going to happen next.
1168,5,"Body Check by Elle Kennedy is a sports themed romance. It is currently hockey season so I was looking for a good hockey themed romance and this one was exactly what I was looking for. In Body Check, good girl scholar Hayden Houston is in Chicago visiting her father. For various reasons she decides to have a one night stand and picks up hockey star Brody Croft at a bar. He is personally not looking for one night stands anymore but he has instant chemistry with Hayden and takes her up on her offer. What then follows is a great romance with a bit of hockey, a bit of drama, and some really great characters. Definitely recommend"
1169,5,This book teaches the basics of story structure and plot devices used successfully by screenwriters and authors for years. It also teaches the basics of the business of selling your story to publishers and producers.
1170,4,"I started purchasing books by this author when one of the first Dundee novels was a free download.  Her characters are believable, and the plots are fun.  You can overlook the contrivances because she makes you care about the characters.  It's a fast, fun read at the end of the day, and I love these kinds of books for relaxation"
1171,3,"The premise of this book was interesting, cloning Jesus Christ.  The story the author wrote was an interesting one, but needed help in transitioning from one sub story to the next.  The reader was left wondering how two different stories intersected.  And just when you thought you understood what was happening, another sub plot was introduced.  While I enjoyed the book, I have to admit that it was one of the most difficult to follow"
1172,1,"I don't realize at the time of getting this that it was a short story. So the story seemed rushed but the worst part was the ending. It wasn't even tragic, just stupidity."
1173,4,here again as before bought the first then the second and third so I have enjoyed this light reading a good story some very inventive new characters and worth keeping going
1174,4,"The thing I like most about Minx Malone's ""Beg for It"" is how she creates two characters of equal standing. Now I quite enjoy an alpha-male, but sometimes it's refreshing to read a story where female characters aren't somehow, in some way, subservient. It goes to show there doesn't have to be such disparity in social status, etc. to create tension or develop plot. I also like how the characters (Mya and Milo) have worked together previously. Their five-year friendship lends the plot credibility, and offers a basis from which their sexual relationship can grow. The dialogue, on the whole, is sharp and witty. The characters are multi-dimensional, the sex scenes steamy.My one criticism concerns how Malone handles her characters' doubts and insecurities towards their burgeoning love affair. (This criticism isn't directed solely at Malone's work but at the genre in general.) For some reason, romance writers disperse this one piece of information repeatedly. In ""Beg for It"", Milo is a `player' with a never-ending stream of buxom, blond beauties. This leaves Mya questioning her own worthiness, as well as Milo's true intentions towards her and their future. Yes, as a reader, I need to know the story's major complication(s) and the characters' internal thoughts. Yes, as the author, Malone needs to communicate this effectively. But do we need to be told this over and over and over again? I don't think so. I get it the first time, and I'm fairly certain lots of other readers do, too.Having said this, I totally recommend Malone's novel. My grievances are minor and Malone's work is worthy of our appreciation."
1175,3,"It was an OK read although at sixty seven I found it a bit juvenile, but i was pleased with the way it stretched my mind."
1176,4,"(cross posted from the blog Wading Through Electronic Ink)In Night Camp, Shane's parents are forcing him to go to summer camp, and in retaliation, he insists upon going to the strangest camp he can find - Night Camp, where campers sleep all day and explore the world at night. But soon after their arrival, Shane, his cousin Brad, and fellow camper Nicole begin to suspect that the people running the camp might be vampires.Overall I found Night Camp to be a cute and engaging story about the adventures of kids at a summer camp. It brought back lots of memories of my times at summer camp, and I found myself wishing that I too could have spent my summers living in a castle and exploring caves instead of the much more traditional cabins and canoeing that I remember. Of course, I was also grateful that I was not entirely cut off from adults and the outside world while at the mercy of people who I suspected might want to use my blood as a midnight snack.Night Camp was written for a younger audience than what I usually review, and I sometimes had a difficult time putting myself in the mindset of a younger child. If I were to encounter a vampire, I would immediately try to determine which of the many vampire mythologies in fiction most closely resembled the creatures with which I was presented. But clearly the average 13-year-old does not have the experience or analytic capability to try to understand vampires on this level. To him, a vampire is simply a blood-sucking monster, though whether such an assumption is fair is the whole point of the book.While I don't know that I would recommend Night Camp to my usual audience, it is definitely the kind of thing that might appeal to the ten-year-old in your life."
1177,3,"Overall this is a fun story.  It starts a little slow but gets interesting fairly quickly.  It opens with Josh and Ryan meeting, getting nasty and going their separate ways.  With the introduction of paparazzi photos of their indiscretion, the actual story takes off.  There are hidden cameramen, family harassment, stress, arguments and fights to get the ball rolling.  And, once it got going, it was pretty fun.Before the book's climax, it wasn't too difficult to sort out who was behind the photo stalking - although to be honest I was only half right...There are a few sub-plot elements that didn't seem necessary such as including Josh's ex-brother-in-law, but they weren't so prevalent as to get in the way."
1178,5,I read this book and it really gave me something to think about. The way God works in ours lives and we don't really know how much.
1179,5,cute short story...and if you love Nalini Singh's Guild Hunter series then you will enjoy reading this novella too.  Always nice to have some back story to other characters in the books we enjoy.
1180,3,"I just finished reading this Kindle book; it was a fairly enjoyable read, but the high number of errors in the writing really brought down my opinion of it. Either the author was in too big a hurry to get it out to properly proof it, or his knowledge of language usage is really lacking.Numerous instances of ""you're"" when it should have been ""your"", ""there"" instead of ""their"", ""where"" instead of ""were"", ""here"" instead of ""hear"", plus several more. Coming across these klinkers in the story are like skating along and suddenly hitting a rock.Spell check wouldn't have caught any of these things; they were spelled correctly, just used incorrectly. This author has the potential to turn out some good reading, he just needs to use a bit more care or ask help in proofing."
1181,3,"If I could give this story 3 1/2 stars instead of 3, I would have. This is basically a love story about a physically & mentally damaged guy who has pretty much stayed in the shadows due to his deformity. That doesn't stop him from getting what he wants - whether success in the financial world or his share of women. His main thing is not letting anyone close to him.Well...along comes Katie who has become an object of his desire and lust due to a self-portrait of her that he purchased from the coffee shop she works in. Of course she becomes his current challenge to get her into bed. However, he hasn't ever encountered someone like Katie - she meets him head on in his sexual whims and desires but she is also a pure loving soul who sees past his deformity. She's not out to get anything from him except his love. In the first half of the story, I was a little taken aback by how easily Katie fell into his sexual wishes so soon and sudden. Cain came across a bit like a stalker, lurking in the night - but it was understood that he preferred the darkness of the night so he could hide his deformity. He also came across as hot and cold and it was puzzling to Katie.Of course since he doesn't believe he is deserving of her love, he initially pushes her away with cruel and cold words. But credit has to be given to Katie - she didn't slink away or let his mean words push her away..initially. I kept thinking that if someone said those means things to me, I would have been gone in a flash. But because she didn't let his words push her away, he started to see the relationship in a different light. But of course his demons kept coming out and eventually it did accomplish in pushing her away.The second half of the story was simply a realization. It takes a true love to take you out of the darkness and into the light...but only if you can see it in yourself that you are worthy of being loved. Love isn't easy - when you find that love you have to hold on. And that's what Cain comes to realize in the end. The book started off with light BDSM and turned into a deeper story of love."
1182,5,Very hot with a plot! Loved it reading the next one now! Makes u want to be abducted by aliens. Great read.
1183,5,This book was very interesting and has a great plot.  The characters are complex without being hard to follow.  I had to read the the rest of the books in this great story.
1184,5,Wow what a great book. Don't let the other reviews detour you as I did. Although their are slight simularities to part I ( thats why is labeled II) this book held its own. I loved this book and really enjoyed Lethal as well.
1185,5,"Why can't I find me a Hot cowboy! Wow this had it all, good story, Hot sex, humor etc...Loved the connection that Caleb and Emma had right away, Caleb is my ideal kind of hero, love a man that's an Ex-Marine. This was worth my money and even had a satisfying ending."
1186,5,"Immortality is the Suck by A.M. Riley was a seriously cool read. I did not pick it up initially as I was feeling a little over the whole vamp genre, but I really like the author so eventually gave in and brought it. Despite there being a very obvious romantic relationship between Adam and Peter, most of the book is seen through Adam's POV and is about him dealing with waking up a bit dead and wanting to snack on people. I liked that Adam is a total mess and needs a boot in his behind, but it's his underlying goodness that peeked through every now and then that kept me totally wrapped up in this book. Loads of drama and fast paced action that does not miss a beat. That and some seriously awesome smex."
1187,4,"This is a very good book that marks the end of the Allan Quartermaine era in Africa. Great chases, battles, hunts, romance, and adventures fill its pages with a believable story and life-like characters."
1188,1,I did not enjoy this book whatsoever.  The writing is choppy. The story does not flow well.  The author doesn't do a good job of describing anything.  You are forced to put too many pieces together yourself.  It was not an enjoyable read.
1189,5,A very unique approach to the idea of cooking and perfectly formatted for the Kindle.  It's great.
1190,4,"4.5 stars.I really enjoyed this book because the relationship between Owen, the Dom, and Sterling, the sub, develops slowly and because it sort of starts from wrong premises.At the very beginning of the book Sterling tries to channel his frustration about his strained relationship with his father into a BDSM relationship, thinking of being a natural Dom. During his first night in a club he understands that he craves being a sub and he sets his eyes on Owen, his former professor, who initially refuses him. Sterling is stubborn and he stalks Owen until the Dom accepts him.Their relationship is very interesting because probably it's not easy to bring to submission a young man, like Sterling, who wants things his way, but Owen has the patience and restraint of a saint. Sterling is naturally undisciplined, but it's because it seems impossible for him to accepts the rules imposed by Owen at their face value, he wants to know the whys and hows, in a way he wants their relationship to be balanced. Owen is not a perfect Dom, and with that I mean that he is not one of the masters that get everything right at their first try, reading their subs as if they were books. On the contrary, he has his doubts, he realizes that he has to cave in sometimes, what I liked about him is that he really wants to help and teach Sterling. I'd say that this book falls on the lighter side of BDSM.I can't give a full rating because it wasn't really overwhelming for me. Maybe Owen was too gentle and too wise, but I think he should have pushed Sterling a little more, just to make everything a little bit more intense."
1191,4,"How does a wizard who has taken an Oath of Magical Non-Violence protect his household and his village in dangerous times?  Wistril, cranky and reclusive, undertakes to do just that in this lighthearted collection.  ""Stealth and guile may win"", he instructs Kern, his sarcastic and dubious apprentice, ""where fury and might may not.""Kern and major-domo goblin Sir Knobby; with a miscellaneous staff of goblins, phantoms, and magical creatures more or less real, are responsible for carrying out the often apparently lame-brained instructions of their irascible master. Anything from nurturing orphaned sea monsters to learning the correct cutlery arrangement for an Oomish engagement party to undermining the underpinnings of a bridge may be required of them at any time.Kern's adolescent snark is authentic and well done, and Wistril has some great lines, (""The Oath prohibits offensive arcane actions, not malicious carpentry""); but his character could use a bit more development - rounding out as well as rotundity.  The dialogue throughout is very good, and the stories well paced.4   Stars. There were just a few editing errors that kept me from giving this book 5 stars, but more Wistril stories would be very welcome.Rated G - readers 8 to 80+ can enjoy this book."
1192,5,WOW! Thats really all i can say about this book. I read it within 2 hours and put it down with only one thought....Wow!I def. recommend this book. If your fantasies needs a little spice..this is the read for you!Way to Go Maya Banks...you have a new fan
1193,5,"Caitlin Moore is on the brink of finally achieving her goal of finishing law school and having the job of her dreams.  She'd once put off her own desires and put a man's needs ahead of her own but she learned her lesson and isn't about to ever let another man dictate the course of her life.  However, she fully admits that she enjoys having a man in her bed and it's been too long since she's indulged in some down and dirty sexcapades.School's out for winter break and Caitlin's determined to have a good time before returning to her normal life of responsibility and control.  The last thing she expects is to run into a blast from the past called Eamon Blake, an Irishman with whom she'd shared a hot summer fling while staying in Ireland working at his family's pub.  They'd been great friends with benefits back then and Caitlin has no qualms about reawakening that side of their relationship.Eamon made the move from Ireland to establish a photography business in Las Angeles after the death of his father.  He's in Seattle where he has a few shoots to do for clients but running into Caitlin is a huge unexpected bonus.  He'd had a great time with Caitlin in Ireland and he's more than interested in reestablishing the sexual side of their relationship.  What he doesn't expect is the sudden desire for their relationship to be more than casual despite the fact that he isn't ready to settle down.Eamon's only going to be in Seattle for a week so they agree to enjoy the time they're together and part as friends.  Only neither of them is able to let go and via phone calls and occasional visits they continue their affair long distance.  At some point the long distance affair isn't going to cut it any longer.  Will their relationship survive an ultimatum or will they both find themselves alone and heartbroken over what may have been?Lauren Dane books have become a staple in my reading library.  Her stories are character driven, emotional, and always a lot of fun to immerse yourself in for a few hours.  ALWAYS tells the story of a couple who is perfect together yet they live twelve hundred miles apart and the time they spend apart is wearing on both of them.  I was able to empathize with both Eamon and Caitlin's points of view and my heart broke for each of them.Long distance relationships are extremely difficult to manage but I love how Eamon and Caitlin seem to handle the situation so effortlessly.  The secondary characters add a fun characteristic to the story with their interference in Eamon and Caitlin's relationship. Eamon's sister-in-law is especially delightful since she seems to especially enjoy antagonizing Eamon.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"

1195,4,"This is a good little mystery with quite a few not-so-subtle digs at the stereotypical new money California crowd from a few years ago when real estate boomed. I was concerned that the humor would get old and ruin the read, but it really doesn't. It's more like you'll be reading these situations and get all into it and then stop and say'what?!' And you can laugh because it's really just a few degrees of exaggeration. This is no blockbuster but if you're looking for a quick, light read it'll do!"
1196,3,"Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie ""left-handed,"" vs. a truth which is ""right-handed"" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars)."
1197,5,"""Oh yeah, come to the party,"" Emma had said. ""Simon will be there and he wants you,"" she said. When did that transform into getting torn to shreds by an evil bitch? Becky isn't about to let Livia get a piece of her without giving something back, but those sure are some strange sounds coming out of that woman. Finding out that your best friend, your best friend's new boyfriend, and the man you have been lusting after are other than human is a bit of a shocker, but Becky is no weak-willed lady Plus, she has to decide the fate of the bitch that had attacked her.When Simon finally gets Becky secured in his home, the Puma in him purrs. If he had any doubts at all about her being his mate, they had been erased at the scent of her blood and the sight of Livia crouched over her in the Friedelinde's garden. It was a good thing Becky had not even jokingly mentioned killing Livia as Livia's punishment for attacking her, because Simon would not have hesitated killing Livia for spilling his mate's blood. In fact, it had only been the fear in Becky's face, fear of him, that had stopped him from doing that anyway. He would have to work on that fear.We got a taste of the Simon/Becky romance in ""The Wallflower"", the story that introduced the Halle Pumas, but now they are back with a vengeance to resume their story in Sweet Dreams. Becky is as sassy as ever and Simon is sweet, strong, and sexy with a healthy dosing of protectiveness and possessiveness from both the man and the Puma. Seriously, what woman wouldn't love the guy? Though I have to say I'm rather glad Becky doesn't just fall all over him because this story is a great deal funnier for it. If I had one problem with this story it was that it was too darn short and that I didn't want it to end, but if that isn't the best recommendation I can give for a story, I just don't know what is."
1198,5,I felt the book was very well written I was so engrossed in the book until I could not put it down and went to look for other books written by this author. It was a GOOD BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1199,4,"Nashville police detective Jack Riley is investigating a drug case, but changes venues to rescue mechanic Alexandra Morgan from the date from hell.  Following the murder of her brother, Alex has come to town seeking sexual freedom having worked under the close thumb of her father at his garage in Dahlia, Tennessee.Without exchanging names, Jack and Alex have incredible sex before going their separate ways.  She returns to her hometown as a good girl while he goes back undercover working the drug case.  A lead takes him to the Dahlia Speedway where his love of fast cars enables him to pretend to be a race-car driver.  When they meet up, each knows the attraction remains strong.  However, both share the same mission of finding the cold blooded killer who murdered her brother and his police partner.OUT OF CONTROL is fast-paced in the bedroom, the race track and several places in between as Jack and Alex prove the body can go from zero to ninety in nanoseconds.  The police procedural romance is filled with suspense and tension as each investigates related homicides until they team up as he fears she will be next if she remains OUT OF CONTROL; that is outside his touch.  Although the shared allure between the cop and the amateur sleuth never fully shifts into gear, readers will enjoy this heated romantic suspense.Harriet Klausner"
1200,5,"What to say?  This book is just wonderful. I am normally not a fan of apoplectic fiction, but this book transcends that genre.  It is adventure on a grand scale condensed into a small but varied cast of characters.  I loved it and honestly feel that it will appeal to a broad range of readers."
1201,5,"Marriage hell. A lot of us have been there. That's the road Quinn and Libby travel down. With hard work and a lotta good loving, the two get past their bump in the road. Amping up your sex life can cure what ails the two of you or give you the shot you need to deal with the rest."
1202,5,I read this book a long time ago and I seem to remember more romance and less intrigue! The spiritual content was approximately the same. I did enjoy rereading The Tryst.
1203,2,This was a Kindle down load and I was dissapointed that none of the music notes where on the pages as in the regular music book of any kind.  Would not recommend this on a Kindle if you need the music notes with it.
1204,5,"This was my first real modern romance. For a while I was trapped in regency England where the more intimate scenes stretched into full on twenty page chapters and every freakin button is erotic. Kelly helped me see the light. If not without this book, I don't think I would have branched out and found some of my favorite authors. I love Kelly, and I encourage everyone to read her books. They're great and um, eye opening."
1205,5,This is one of the best series of books by Lora Leigh I  would recommend it to all my friends
1206,5,Great book I would have never believed it would have ended the way it did I will not be the spoiler on this book but I highly recommend you read it. It has a awesome twist in the end.
1207,4,"Truck Stop is a culmination of all that is evil and perverse. Perennial killers Taylor and Donaldson, two corrupt souls find solace in a demented embrace at a roadside tuck stop. The initial victim; a prostitute whose body is seen as little more than a piece of meat ripe for dismemberment and consumption before the predators set their sights on police officer Jack Daniels. However, you could say, they bit off more than they could chew in underestimating Daniels' survival instinct and hardened police training. Truck Stop is a brief interlude into the Jack Daniels saga and a good entry point for those unfamiliar with the character. Not a word is wasted in this thriller that touches on our deep seeded fear of experiencing a kidnapping, forced cannibalism and slow death. 4 stars."
1208,4,"The book was easy to read and keep everyone where they belonged.  The girls had such a tragedy but found a closeness and deep love for each other.  Finding their own magic and how to use it for the good of themselves and others showed them how teamwork could accomplish much.  The ending was just right,"
1209,4,"Jeff Inlo writes books that deal with the bigger issues of life. There is no unnecessary violence or sexual innuendo that the reader has to deal with yet our heroes deal with hatred, those seeking power for their own ends, revenge and forgiveness. For those wishing to read a book with a simple message in a fantasy setting, this is it."
1210,5,OMFG!!!! This book is so good!!!! The ending is so insane!!!! My favorite part is when Antonio and Santos save Jane. This book deserves 5 stars baby!!
1211,5,I just read 11-15 of the Westmoreland books. I can't pick a favorite because they were all good. Now I must continue my journey through the Westmoreland family love. I really enjoy the family Brenda Jackson has created. Thank you for sharing with us Mrs. Brenda Jackson.
1212,5,"I really enjoyed this book but I must complain that it was too short.  I would glady pay more for more substance.  The love scenes were hot, hot, hot.  Just too short....."
1213,5,This is a very good case for the kindle DX. No it is not hard but it will protect from those short drops like if u knock it off the night stand. More important it will keep your kindle warm if you leave it for an hour or so in a cold car while shopping. Cold and electronics do not play nicely.
1214,4,"You hardly ever imagine a ""happily-ever-after"" like this.  But this book seems honest in it's portral of a relationship after 5 years of marriage.  It was a good read overall.  I highly enjoy most things written by this author."
1215,3,"Does this seem like Wreathru fan fiction to anyone else? They are different genres, but the similarities are hard to ignore: Deiara vs Hara, Tyre vs Tir and the reproductive egg synched it for me. It was a good read with complexity and intrigue for a hermaphrodite romance. Despite the being hermaphrodite, the characters conformed to traditional male/female roles (or should I say dom/sub roles). ....not particularly socially challenging or forward thinking, but I'm interested enough in the world to see what the next books have to offer."
1216,4,"At times this was a really good story, at others it wasn't. But it sure was a worthwhile book, nevertheless.Sandra Mercer was surprised to find her daughter Carla wearing a letter sweater that Sandra knew belonged to the boy she'd once planned to marry, 30 years ago.  Carla's new boyfriend, Kevin, was the nephew of that man, Jack Dawson - and Jack had just moved back to town!  As the story continued, the things that had happened over those thirty years to both people, the reasons why things had happened as they did, all were made known.  Also, that Jack and Sandra still loved one another - but after all that time, it may not be possible to be together.  Especially because of a sailboat race, something Jack wanted to take part in, that turns so deadly that Jack and the crew may never return."
1217,5,"This was a great story. I loved each of the 3 chapters.I wish it had been an entire book, so that I could get more background on the 'whys' of the 2 main characters.I have to wonder what the 'One Star' reviewers expected. I mean the name implies it is about Serial Killers. The blurb was right on target.Of course it's gruesome & disturbing & sick.Geez, have those reviewers reviewed Peter Pan and given it 1 star because ""it's a kid's book"".It's pretty ridiculous to rate a book low because it fits its genre."
1218,2,"Story concept is good, but it is not fully developed. Good mix of spice, but something seems to be missing."
1219,5,Emma Darcy has always been a good writer I love reading her books. they are the best pick me up when I am in a funk so as always great read.
1220,2,"Pamina, Goddess of Passion and Everything Enchanted is summoned by the pledge of three friends determined to swear off men. With a touch of magic and a bite of an apple, she hires the three women who share a design company to renovate an Old Victorian and turn it into a sexual retreat, with each friend taking a room to decorate according to their deepest fantasies. Lindsay Bell, the bawdy bad girl of the trio, is intent on a BDSM room that'll tickle her fancy. What she hadn't planned on was gorgeous handyman Brad Caldwell to help her. Soon all Lindsay can think of is trying out - with Brad - all the new toys for the room and getting Brad to take her where she's always wanted to go...the pledge to swear off men be damned.Unfortunately, I had some problems with this novella on just about every front. Beyond the set up of the concept for the plot, there just wasn't much attention given to plot or character development, and the relationship between Brad and Lindsay suffered as a result. Seeming perfunctory and shallow, neither lends to the sort of tone that would allow for a seductive BDSM scene...but that doesn't even really become an issue because the 'play' in this role play was exceedingly tame. Not that I would have wanted hard core, I didn't. But I just couldn't suspend my disbelief...and a bit of distaste...in part because the development of the characters and relationship were so sparse, and in part because I just didn't buy the idea that Lindsay would in just a few days time share with Brad a kink (a relatively harmless kink, really) that she'd never mentioned to any of her other boyfriends before. There are just too many problems with that all around.There was an attempt to add some depth to Brad's character, and much of that attempt succeeded. I liked his issues with wanting to go to med school and the problems he's had with women over his blue collar job. He and the not-quite-a-cat were my two favorite parts of this novella. I wish there had been more time spent on and with both of them and less on Lindsay, who's unrelenting focus on sex and not much else turned me off.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."
1221,3,"An action novel written in the old, slow-paced style of yesteryear. The story is really hard to get into because one has to wade through so much unnecessary description."
1222,5,i`ve read these again- i read them several times in paperback (have paperback collection) and enjoy having them with me always
1223,3,"The storyline is interesting, characters well developed. The writer obviously has a good knowledge in writing which makes reading enjoyable instead of feeling like one is reading bullet points. Good read."
1224,5,"I bought the very 1st one for free... and I download lots of free crap.This book, though, I really enjoyed, and downloaded the next ones - I am anxiously awaiting the next one.Do read!"
1225,1,"The book is unrealistic, I regretted not reading in time by the time I started reading 7days were over and I could not return it. I tried to trudge along without success. There is no character development and I am an avid reader of m&eacute;nage and BDSM books but the heroine in this book came out looking like a carpet that the two guys walked over. I hated it and I regret wasting my money."
1226,5,"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I'm just happy to finally read one of Ms. Lee's book where the main female isn't accusing some guy of false rape, when in all actuality she wanted the sex just as much as the man she accusing!!!!. That is the most annoying thing ever it totally ruins the book for me when she does that. But this book was totally different and made me a believer again. I'm not going to lie I did take a break from Ms. Lee but bc of the FALL OF TROY I'm back on track."
1227,1,"I couldn't' finish this.  I'm sure it's a great erotic novel, but I guess I was expecting some sort of plot."
1228,5,I would recommend this story to everyone who loves adventures.  This should be made into a movie.  I love all the characters Seth is my favorite.
1229,5,"I love Scott Fitzgerald and the way he writes. This collection is a great book of short stories. My daughter actually needed it for reading material for her class at school and she was surprised it was different than the movie withBrad Pitt. Still, if you like Fitzgerald, it is a good fast read. Good short stories."
1230,4,Not a bad storyline. Definitely not a BDSM romance. Thank god!!!!! I liked how this story had a twisted story with it. I enjoyed it. I wish it could've been longer but a novella is a novella.
1231,4,"This book was previously reviewed at RedAdeptreviews.comPlot/story: 5 StarsI really enjoyed reading this first book in the Jason Dark series. The green mist that sucks life energy and moisture from people grabbed my attention and held me captive to the story from the very beginning. When that green mist turned into a minor demon seeking to gain power enough to release its ""Father"" from a metaphysical prison I was enthralled.Characters: 5 StarsInnumerable times throughout the book I felt as if I were reading a new version of Sherlock Holmes, one that was immersed in action and occult studies. Jason Dark was wonderfully depicted, as was Siu Lin. I could see that Siu Lin was probably being set up to be Dark's ""Watson"" sidekick in later books. Her knowledge of occidental mythos paired nicely with Dark's knowledge of western occult.Writing style: 3 StarsFor such a great story, the lack of dialog stuck out horribly. More than once, I felt like I was reading a silent movie. The descriptions were fantastic, but the almost complete lack of dialog really was bothersome. There were also a couple of odd adverb choices that threw me out of the story a bit.The scenes were well thought out, and the descriptions of London conveyed a wonderful ""feel"" to the whole book.Reviewer's Notes:1. I enjoyed this book immensely, and purchased the second book in the series to see if the dialog issue was prevalent there also. I am pleased to note that it was not a problem in the second book at all.2. This book was reviewed as given to Red Adept Reviews. After looking at the Amazon page, I did see that the book had been revised. I do not know what issues have been fixed in the revised edition."
1232,5,"Great read!  Very descriptive - i could almost hear the sounds of the balloons taking off!  If you love a good mystery, chicken enchiladas, hot air balloons, Albuquerque and/or wonderful characters.....you will love this book and the series."
1233,5,"Left to die by her werewolf mates after they are convinced she betrayed them and killed their father, Heather survives against the odds, though without the men she loves more than life itself, her soul feels dead inside.Now Cael and Riyu have learned the truth, and realize their own terrible betrayal of their beautiful mate.  They will do anything to make it up to Heather and earn her forgiveness, but is it too late?  Has her trust in them been irrevocably broken?Leave it to Maya Banks to have me bawling my eyes out over the Christmas holiday.  With her holiday release, Love Me, Still, Ms. Banks tore my heart to shreds.  Between my past experience with this author's stories and the publisher's synopsis, I really should have expected as much, in hindsight.Never has Maya Banks' ability to instill empathy for her characters in the reader been more evident than in this story.  I felt everything that Heather felt.  I ached when she ached for the loss of her mates.  I sobbed when she cried over the hurt she saw in her mates' eyes when they believed she had betrayed them.  And when they returned to her, I felt the same joy Heather did at her return to the mates and the pack she so cherished.In the midst of all that raw emotion, it never occurred to me what the story didn't have.  It wasn't until later as I reminisced over the story that it struck me - this is the first Maya Banks title I have ever read that has no sex scene.  You read that right - none whatsoever.  And you know what?  As much as I have enjoyed this author's undeniable talent at crafting love scenes that would melt the paint off a car, I didn't even notice it wasn't there while I read the story.  It worked very well without it.  In fact, I would venture so far to say that if adding a sex scene to this story meant cutting any other part of the tale, I would absolutely not want it.  Love Me, Still was that perfect.  If anyone should doubt Maya Banks' writing talent, this story can be held up as a prime example of her ability to stir emotions without needing sex to do so.When I am in the mood for a good tearjerker with a beautiful love story featuring the reuniting of lovers, Love Me, Still will be the book I reach for time and again.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**"
1234,3,I would recommend this book to read. It's has a lot of rough sex scenes. so if your not into it I wouldn't recommend this book.. but all in all its good cold day read..
1235,5,"I enjoyed every minute reading this book.  I love Time Travel, I love Pirates and I love Romance ... the sparks between Becca & James were sexy and very hot.  When I sit down to read, I want to be entertained and this book did not disappoint.  If you're looking for a wild ride in the time of Pirates with a strong, independent modern woman of today's world in the mix  ... then this is your book."
1236,3,"The cover and blurb are great. The premise awesome, but while the writing is decent, I wasn't satisfied when done. It lacked a certain something. More character depth? A little more time spent on their connection maybe?"
1237,4,"Elements of typical novels abound, story a bit far fetched even for the genre, but very decent, likeable characters with suspense thrown in. I actually read it twice."
1238,2,This book was such a struggle for me to read. I was annoyed and bored for awhile. Then I just gave up and did not finish it. This book was not my cup of tea.
1239,5,I was very satisfied with all the stories in this book. I strongly recommend anything this author has done as being worthy of purchase and the time it takes to read it.
1240,4,"Estoy conforme con &eacute;l, sin embargo es un poco pesado, casi tanto como el Kindle Dx. Ser&iacute;a mejor que diera la misma protecci&oacute;n, pero con un peso menor."
1241,5,After reading history about the air war and armor war this makes a nice way to excuse oneself from the table without an argument.
1242,4,This was a different read for me.  For the most part I did enjoy the book.  How difficult life is for people with mental issues. Good read.  I found it hard to put down..
1243,4,"This story is very sensuous, there is food, flowers and romantic obsession. She was raised to be his wife. He didn't want her, and as a result all doors closed to her. She chose perhaps the most difficult path out of her predicament, but she is never entirely free of the beginning of her story -- until she finally is forced to face it. Good sci-fi, good writing, loved the ending."
1244,5,"This and all of this series is very well written.  I resented having to put the book down to do things like feed my family, clean the house, go to work etc!!!  I must have burned through all of the books written so far in less than two weeks!  The last one had a cliff hanger at the end, and now I want to be on the waiting list for the next book!!!!!!"
1245,2,I have read all theses tails before and they just seemed to be the old ones with different names  so it was a wast of a down load
1246,4,"This book was well-written and thought out. While the story didn't grab me, I think it was more my mood at the time and nothing related to the book."
1247,5,I really liked it but it should have been longer.. I didn't want to stop reading this.I can't wait to read more
1248,5,This is the first book in the Heroes of Silver Springs. I totally loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I started it. I loved how these two people came back together after years of being apart. I must admit it made me think of the guy I was crushing on when I was in High School wondering what he thought of me. LOL. I loved how Veronica has become her own woman and has decided to do what she wants and feels like doing instead of what others expect of her and want her to do. I loved how she was able to knock Dean off balance from the beginning. I really enjoyed watching these two people learn about each other and fall in love. I think that this is going to be a great series to read because I know that if the rest of the series is as good as this one then we are in for a treat!
1249,1,"A lot of the reviews on this book were conflicting, making it really unclear if this would be an enjoyable book for me, so let me just speak plainly about it: I thought it was a waste of the time it took me to grind through 24% of this book.  The rapper was extremely difficult to understand speech wise, probably because I didn't have an ebonics dictionary right next to me.  The woman seemed to waffle back and forth about seeing this guy, and there seemed to be little or no history built into these characters in that short time frame of the book. Perhaps further along in the book, there is some insight as to why these two people act the way they do, but not being able to understand the speech patterns or methodology of these people made it too difficult for me to be able to care enough to get to that point.  Thank goodness I picked it up for free, as I would have hated to waste money on this book."
1250,4,ENJOYED the book had lots of detail and excitement . I liked the part where he cleared the land to put the lodge back up for him to use.
1251,5,"I really enjoyed reading this book about Tamara & Kendrick Prince of Bondair. They meet at club and he has been eyeing her since she walked in the club. When she tells her sister she had enough, she leaves and Kendrick follows her and confronts her in the park. They have amazing chemistry but she still walks away. Read this book because it will make you laugh and cry and cum a lot."
1252,5,This book gives a light hearted feeling. It is humorous with very erotic sex scenes. Definitely a man's dream but I liked it.I recommend this book.
1253,4,Good short story. I did feel it was rushed through. Other than that I enjoyed reading this story. Worth 99 cents.
1254,5,"I loved this and babies are always, in most cases, the result of true love and family.  I love happy ending"
1255,5,This series is super! Each story has such a great hero and heroine. They each a have a fun quirky storyline. The sex scenes are hot! Loved being in bear creek for a few hours. Will definitely be buying more Lori Wilde books.
1256,5,"This book was a recent Kindle Daily Deal and I decided to take a flyer on it. While I like anthologies, ones as topical as this one aren't what I usually read. So I had my doubts about how I'd like it.But the gamble paid off well; I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. The stories range from touching to humorous. While I'm usually not a fan of 'country humor' (who can compare to Twain?), the humorous stories in this book weren't bad. The non-humorous ones were pretty good.Even though I wasn't raised in the South, all of my extended family was and many of these stories reminded me of my childhood when I used to spend time there."
1257,3,"This was a book of short interviews from people that were slaves or their relatives were slaves.  Some lived to be 60 to over or near 100 years old.  They discussed their living conditions, their work, their families, their children, their masters good and bad.  They did have recreation time and time for church.  The masters took good care of their sick so they could get back to work. They talked about the Union Soldiers helping them out during the war.  They discussed after the war when they were free and how hard it was without any education to get work some stayed on the plantations.  I enjoy American history."
1258,5,"I certainly hope there is a Book three...love these books!!!  Have a Reader's hope, now, for Mankind...Given our Higher Spirit Selves!"
1259,5,"Once again, I have finally read this classic story for the first time. I was vaguely aware of the story line but thoroughly enjoyed reading it from cover to cover."
1260,4,"I really like the way they got along, separate but together. How friends became lovers. They weren't afraid to express their feelings. I will read this book again."
1261,2,"I picked this book up based on the earliest reviews - the first 6 reviews all gave it 5 stars!  The 1-3 star reviews that follow the initial gushing 5 star reviews are probably a bit more realistic.The premis of the story is quite good, but unfortunately the characters can't pull it off.  The good guy is one dimensional and, whilst there is plenty of back story...some might argue too much...there wasn't enough personality to keep me engaged.  Same issues for the 'baddies'.  Unfortunately I found myself looking at the '% read' at the bottom of the kindle and thinking 'Oh, still 40% to go.'  I had my next book lined up and, but not wanting to just give up, which is a last resort (only done with 2 books since I got the kindle) I pushed on and tried to get into it.I give it 2 stars based on the story and the price and plus the fact that I considered stopping mid way through.  I'm glad I finished it, but wont be hunting for the next one in the series."
1262,5,"Really enjoyed this book - it was fabulous! I loved the witty, engaging, fun tone of the book and I loved how intelligent and well written it was. All the plot elements were tied up nicely and the characters felt real and unique. They had a great chemistry and it was both romantic and funny - my favourite combination! Great read, recommended, thank you!"
1263,1,This was not a book I would especially recommend. The writing style was not great and the story was kind of predictable.  It is just a nice light summer read but I wouldnt recommend it.
1264,4,"Ava March has a wonderful ability to take just a few pages and fully envelop the reader in her character's world.  Because of this, you get a short but great read with well developed characters and heartfelt connections.  Thank you Ms. March. :)"
1265,5,"In Blurred Nights Marc is Blake's sire to become a vampire. Blake is a unique vampire in the world where they join humans to fight the demons that come from the earth to kill humans and spread terror. The immature Blake finds fighting demons a game, although a deadly game, while Marc is committed to the ancient ideas that vampires were put on earth to protect and help humans.The conversations full of wit between the two vampires, the underlying love for each other that they will not express in words and the competition for the attentions of the beautiful human woman fighter, Kate makes this a great story. Blake keeps coming up with new ways to keep the story flowing and interesting along with the well written sex scenes as they keep hunting the demon's breech.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review; the opinions expressed are my honest opinions. If you like paranormal and vampires, this is a very good story that I highly recommend."
1266,2,"It's a kindle freebee,  but it appears to have sold for $16 and may do so again... If i paid $16 I would howling loudly,  as it is,  I merely sighed and will quietly remove it from my kindle.  It's just... uninspiring.  Not wall bangingly bad,  just boring - blandly written,  poor characters,  total clich&eacute;s,  so surprises.  I didn't finish it (so there may be a massive surprise at the end,  but that feels highly unlikely to me!) A freebee has to be finished to get 3 stars,  so I'm giving it 2..."
1267,5,"I look forward to getting to the next books, and sometimes can't recall exactly what the book was about, but it is a very good book, and real good reading.'"
1268,3,"3.5 starBRIEF SUMMARYAmber is excited when she meets her high school crush, Brain. Both had an instant attraction that led to a steamy encounter. When both encounters a misunderstanding, they still manage to not get along but physically wants and take each other repeatedly.THOUGHTSI thought this was a very spicy book. I am always first in line to read high school crushes who reunites later in life. Amber and Brain got together for a steamy night, but, with a misunderstanding everything goes wrong. Soon after and unable to get enough of each other with their bedroom aerobics, both characters steams up the pages with a sex only relationship. I liked that even though the relationship was purely sexual, we got to see Brain slowly learning and reconnecting more about Amber, and I found that to be sweet. Although I thought this story was sexually charged, and sweet, I found the storyline to be ok. I liked it, but didn't find myself connecting with certain scenes. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this book.Story: FAIRIntimacy: D.R.I.P = Don't Read In Public / GOODEnjoyment: FAIR to GOODRomance Novel Junkies"
1269,4,"yes there were typos and the occasional word confusion which ordinarily would drive me nuts but the story, the possibility of these events, were mesmerizing. it does however need a sequel. im invested in these characters and want more. i want to know what happened next. did they survive? find a way out? the story cannot end there..."
1270,5,"Danny was a hoot!  Took a chance and ordered this and I stayed up and read this completely.  Found myself laughing out loud because Laney was feisty and had a conscience.  Her boss was something else (can we say ho-ho-ho?)and I have to say I was pleased when she did slap him up awake.  His family seemed a little odd, but I guess he took after his father.  Would like to know why she wasn't sure about her family meeting him.  I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this particular author."
1271,2,"Absolutely one of the worst mysteries I've read - well, the mystery was not all that bad, but the writing was very vanilla.  By that I mean: fairly simple sentences and almost no interesting, imaginative adjectives.  About half way through, I was bored, and I ""paged forward"" to the end just to see who the murderer was.  A surprise - which is the only reason I gave it two stars.  Further, I could not figure out how the perp knew where the to-be victims were and how to get at them.  Maybe that was in the part I skipped."
1272,5,"Evangeline Anderson is one of my favourite writers and despite the shortness of this book I think it is one if her better ones.  You have to be prepared to let reality go a bit to get into it but that is no problem for me! Good characters, sex that makes you squirm (in a good way) and maybe a new business idea......really enjoyed it"
1273,4,"Being a fan of historical fiction, I was drawn in right away with Children of Salem. This is and area of American history that I have never read a whole lot on and was anxious to learn more about. I found myself going back and researching online what was written in the book to see what was fiction and based on fact. I was suprised to find how historicly accurate Robert W. Walker was and how little I actually knew about the Salem Witch Trials, based on what I have seen on TV and read in the past. A great book for anyone who is interested in history, a fan of mystery, and even romance. Why pay $14.99 or $9.99 for a new release when you can download several of Robert Walkers novels for the price of one new release."
1274,5,"Brilliant book and series. Well researched, conceived and brilliantly executed.  Gifted author. Can't wait to read more.Earl Stevens, PhD"
1275,4,"fun, but not a lot of substance.  You can't help but like the characters and root for them through out, but it was a bit predictable."
1276,5,"Terri Reed, has become one of my favorite authors by far!  Her stories always draw you in and captivate you. This story , taking place in a home for the elderly hit home with me. Things unfortunately go on inside those places that should never happen. I also found her references to religion and the characters unshakable faith more believable .Reading this story helped me know that I had made the right decisions in the case of my own loved one. There are lessons in this book that everyone should learn and once again she added just enough romance ,and mystery to the story to keep you turning the page...I loved this book"
1277,5,"There are a couple of things you need to consider before you buy this book.  Are you a survivalist?  Do you spend your weekends thinking up ways to survive once society collapses?  Do you keep a store of medical supplies, canned foods, and firearms and practice using them in extreme conditions?  If this is the kind of thing you enjoy doing and thinking about, then ""The Birth of the Peacekeepers."" will be great fun for you and you will find much in common with the book's protagonist.  On the other hand, if think survivalists are nutcases and nightmares of a future world with no people haunt your nights, then you will not enjoy this book in the least."
1278,4,The book was a good read thou it kind of rushed to the end I would like the ending to have been written better
1279,5,"After a year of self imposed celibacy following her break up with her former master Jane Porter is ready to get back into the BDSM lifestyle.  She's not looking for a lifelong love or even a long term relationship but she'd love to find a master who can bring out the full extent of her passion.Even after all this time Jane is still hurt by Peter's betrayal and knows trusting anyone with her heart or body will not be easy.  Her best friend and business partner Lily accompanies her to a bondage-themed event that their business R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up.  It's more than just networking for Jane though, it's her first foray back into the BDSM scene and she just hopes to find one man who appeals to her.Once they arrive at the party location, Lily and Jean Jacques settle into their non-interested attitudes despite the fact that the sexual tension between them is practically off the charts.  Jane's just waiting for Jean Jacques to toss Lily over his shoulder and show her just what she's missing.  Jane spends the evening hunting for a potential master for the night but no one's sparked an interest.  What she doesn't realize is that Antonio Villareal spotted her the moment she entered the ballroom and he has every intention of getting to know her - in every way possible.Antonio isn't having the best of luck when it comes to women.  Sure, he's rich, gorgeous and single but women are only after him because of what they'd gain by being seen on his arm.  He's looking for a submissive woman to share his life and has set his sights on Jane.  The only problem is she's told him upfront she isn't looking for a happily-ever-after.  Some really hot sex in the here and now will do wonders for her but anything further is more than she's willing to consider.  Will Antonio be able to convince her that she can have all the smoldering sex she could ever want if she'd just give him a chance?Dominique Adair's storylines are ones that I'm consistently drawn to over and over.  Her plots and characters never fail to draw the reader into the storyline while promising to seduce you with each heat filled scene.  In SEDUCING JANE PORTER we're introduced to Jane, a character who's love and trust was horribly abused yet she's brave enough to attempt another foray into the BDSM world.  Antonio is exactly the sort of master Jane desires - even if she isn't aware of it yet.  I eagerly read through this story and felt a profound disappointment when it came to an end.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"

Simon has stayed away from women for the past four months and intends to keep it that way until one rainy night when another beautiful stranger shows up at his door.Lottie Santori is in Trouble, Pennsylvania, researching Josef Zangara for her psychology professor.  Zangara made Seaton House an exclusive hotel in the nineteen thirties and was later convicted of being a serial killer.

Lottie's not giving up though; she plans to discover the mystery surrounding the house and Simon, all while trying to seduce him into bed, but strange things are happening.  Is someone out to get Simon?  Or is he going crazy?Leslie Kelly has written another hit with Asking For Trouble!  This funny, sexy, and sometimes spooky story is a blast to read!  Simon had me from the beginning.  His haunted memories and guilt-ridden soul made me want to hold him and never let go.  Lottie is a sweetheart; she's beautiful, witty and fearless too.  The chemistry between Simon and Lottie simply sizzles.  Asking For Trouble is just as entertaining to read as Here Comes Trouble, the first book in this series, and with Trouble Or Nothing still to come, readers get plenty more from the town of Trouble, Pennsylvania, where something scary and passionate is bound to happen!Nannette reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1281,5,"This was such a great start to a wonderful series.  I loved Kari and Andreas story, there were some funny parts.  She showed that she was a strong woman who loved her man. I'm hoping that she writes more stories to this series, because I loved the first two."

A girl lies to her mother about having a boyfriend she lives with (for two years!) works for a hottie veterinary surgeon and of course, secretly fancies him something rotten. She persuades him to come home with her for Christmas and pretend to be the boyfriend! Things go downhill - or uphill, depending on your perspective - from there.This is the perfect frothy, slightly silly, but good-natured romantic fantasy novel to read on a cold and rainy day, snuggled in bed with a hot water bottle and chocolate - as I did  :)"

1284,3,"I am a long-time reader of Lora Leigh's books, and this one was pretty good.  The plot line was predictable but I liked the interaction between Sax and Marey.  However, there is one aspect of this author's writing that I really get tired of, and that is her over-use of phrases such as ""breathed out roughly"", ""spoke roughly"", ""breathed in roughly"", ""whispered roughly"";  please, Ms. Leigh, be aware that when one word is used over and over again in books, ad nauseum, it gets really old fast!  In this particular book, I counted at least 6 times when these types of phrases were used."
1285,1,"I have read Cliff Black stories before but &#34;Perfect Crimes&#34; was like reading an outline of a story or a first effort of a college writer; maybe high school.  I almost quit reading in the first chapter but decided to finish it and hope it got better.  The writing was literal and linear, meaning from the very beginning the reader knew about the crime.  Much of the internal dialogue was repetitive and in some cases unnecessary.  There was no mystery or clues to ferret out what was happening toe the main characters.  Two characters, a husband and wife, find themselves in the midst of a criminal act against them and choose not to engage the police because they think they will get in trouble.  This despite the fact the police begin to uncover clues that something is amiss.  The main characters brother is a policeman and instead of interrogating the main character just accepts &#34;I'll tell you when I retire&#34; statement in response to the question &#34;What is going on?&#34;  No police officer would accept this.  Nor would anyone else, particularly a family member.  Just not believable at all and the ending was....what can I say...incomplete.  It felt as if I fell off a cliff with half of the story unresolved.  Too bad.  A good premise but poorly written."
1286,3,"I thought I was downloading a sample and instead got a complete short story.  Of course it is resolved too quickly,  being only 25 pages (or so it felt,  I read it in about half an hour)  Holly is tired of being a good girl so introduces herself as Jessica to the good looking guy at the club,  then they fall into a broom closet and have amazing sex. Connor loved the sex but surprises himself and wants more. When he meets ""Jessica' again,  he goes for it, but she has enough on her plate and only wants him for sex. So he gives her sex,  but wants a rel.  Eventually he tells off her sister and rebalances her life,  she worries about him when he goes on mission,  and they reunite as a couple.  It's a piece of fluff,  but fine while you are reading it"

1288,5,I love the way Shelli Stevens grabs you and takes you right into her stories.. This was short but sexy I was unaware that I liked the Guy on Guy love making so much.. But this story tells of unconditional love between Four consenting adults and captures your heart while playing with your imagination. I couldn't put it down..
1289,5,This was a very captivating book.  I really enjoyed it.  Made me tear up on several occasions.  A very heartwarming story.  A real steal for free!
1290,5,i absolutely love mckennas booksthis storie was wonderfull . it had huge potential to be a full storie aposed to a short. but it was wonderfull all the same the other two stories are just as good as this one.i just wish they were full stories.
1291,4,An interesting perspective on how both American and Iraqi people may have felt about the occupation of Iraq during the war and shortly thereafter. Plenty of tension to keep your attention through the book.
1292,4,"A solid read. good plot, characters, writing, but the best thing is the feel of the book.  It stays somewhat light despite being a thriller with violence and death.  I read some of the less than flattering reviews and the only one I can fully gree with is that some loose ends were left untied. In particular, the editing was good IMO, and I say this as someone who tends to be very critical of overuse of the verb to be, the passive voice and generally lazy writing. I've read numerous thrillers from major publishers with worse editing than this, so I can't quite fathom where that criticism came from."
1293,3,"When the words ""sadomasochism and bondage"" appeared not far into this book, I was worried. A little bondage, a little swatting - okay - but this book had the darker stuff written all over it. Quite honestly, I almost put it down, but I decided to push ahead for two reasons...1. I knew at any time I could stop reading, delete it from my Kindle, and never think of it again.2. I have yet to read a bad Mari Carr book.Rough Cut is darker, but Ty's love for Gwen is very apparent. Even though he's controlling things in the bedroom, she holds the power. Gwen's struggle to accept her darker desires is handled quite perfectly. I thought Ty was considerate of her throughout the story and never once did I think he crossed a line. Rough Cut is a novella, but it takes place over the course of a few months plus a fabulous epilogue! For me, this will be a one-time read because there wasn't much else to it."
1294,5,"OMG, don't you just love it when a book leaves you with a giddy smile on when you finish it??? LOL, I loved this. He was a bit harsh and he did need to make up for his misconceptions more but they were so perfect for each other. They also did not have sex until both had already known they were in love even if they had not told each other yet. It was sweet. There were a few miscommunications that I felt bad was happening on both their parts but they worked it all out. I adored them and you can tell that they had a connection from the start. She was a virgin, of course, and he was not a womanizer. He still thought she was a gold digger when he wanted her and when she pushed him away after a kiss, he thought he just wanted her because that is what YEARS of celibacy does to a man. I loved that. I always hate the playboy heroes who fall into bed right away with their heroines because (and this is only if they are severe man whores) I start to wonder if they had just come from some other woman the night before and then went straight to the heroine the next night. That is so gross to think about when trying to read about a couple in love and I am SO glad I did not have to even think of this hero with another. He was just so great and if they had more pages, I think we could have gotten more of an apology out of him for his treatment of her. He was not awful but some things he said were hurtful. I like how he found out how wrong he was and because he was already in love with her, he was BEYOND devastated at his previous actions. It was just so good to me."
1295,4,"I really enjoyed this story! From the moment Chloe meets Mark and attempts to dominate him, this story picks up wings. The lovemaking was refreshing and so was the storyline. This was a short story, but complete and well worth the read! I will be looking for more stories by Ms. Evangeline!"
1296,4,"And I don't mean superman, although he certainly has most of those abilities.  Abused as a child he turned into a man with a good heart of steel."
1297,4,"Ruby Halloway has it bad for the CEO of her company, Leo Dunne.  Real bad.  She does everything to avoid him until her best friend helps trip her up at the company masquerade party.  The evening ends with Ruby spending an amazing night in Leo's bed.  From then on, things just keep getting weirder.Leo Dunne has known for quite some time that Ruby is his destined mate.  Now that he has her right where he wants her, he's not letting her out of his sight.  He insists that she go with him to his family home after he receives a call that his brother, Shane, is missing.  Besides, he can better protect the woman he loves if she is with him.  The only trouble is will she be able to accept the truth about who and what he is?When author Dana Marie Bell put together a spunky, adorable heroine (who's a wee bit insecure for good reason) with a tender-hearted, Alpha male (who's somewhat needy in his time of trouble), I was anticipating a storyline strictly revolving around their relationship.  Well, Ruby and Leo get their share of ups and downs, mainly from loads of outside craziness (and crazies).  Along with a cast of kick-butt characters (my personal favorite being A-Rogue-From-Literature-Who-Shall-Remain-Nameless), I appreciated the idea behind the Gray Court; it's fresh and filled with interesting potential.The sex is graphically described and racy, while the dialogue is mostly pink hearts and rose petals with a splash of spiciness thrown in. The overall appeal for me was the humor, which is sometimes snarky, other times wonderfully over the top, and mainly tongue-in-cheek.  No matter which direction the narrative turns, it's sheer fun!  Of course, the lovely cover will wring sighs of longing (or envy) from readers, too.Dare to Believe in love because this story is pure magic and romance at its sweetest.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1298,5,"I loved this book. The characters, J.T and Nikki are great. It is definitely hot and steamy. The story keeps you going and has surprises along the way. I would definitely recommend."
1299,3,"Elena O'Rourke is the junior probationary police detective on the third shift, pining desperately to make full detective status, when the body of Napoleon Shrimpf falls into her lap - metaphorically. Dubbed by Elena to be The Case of the Punctured Prick, she scrambles to solve the crime as she struggles to maintain her rep as a competent cop's daughter (WWDD - What Would Daddy Do - a mantra of hers) amid the frustrations of an unwanted and criminally chatty partner and under the attentions of the sexiest male she's ever seen, Bo Strongwell. And despite the fact that Bo keeps turning up to turn her on and she wants nothing more than solving her case AND ending an achingly long sexual drought (not necessarily in that order), he's a suspect, and puts the suspicious in ""suspicious character.""Strongwell wants nothing more than to protect his town and his...people...until he gets his first taste of Elena, and then the Vikingesque vamp can't get enough of her scent and her taste and HER. But secrets divide them, and as he tries to protect Elena AND keep his true identity hidden, his growing lust and affection may draw her into a deadly threat - not only to her life, but to the future of the whole town.I have to say, I liked Bite My Fire. I thought the plot was engaging and the vampire mythos seemed original enough not to come across as a tired revamping (no pun intended). The setting, Meiers Corners, is chock full of quirky and pop-iconic tertiary characters (like the town gossip and hair cutting maven, Dolly Barton, and the CSI agent whose initials are CSI and who bears a startling resemblance to William Peterson...and for those Buffy aficionados, the vamp prostitute, Drusilla) who add a definite flavor to the mix. And too, while I didn't find it laugh-out-loud funny, I certainly found it humorous enough to make me smile quite a bit through the reading of it. But there were some problems...Most notably, I had some issues with the two lead characters. Written in first person from Elena's point of view, I couldn't seem to truly warm to her and thought too much of her character was defined by her hormones, not enough by her intelligence. I'm all for a lusty lead, but when it's the driving personality trait and to such an extent as it was in Bite My Fire, the character seems a bit too two dimensional. It's a pity, too, because there was definitely enough backstory provided to give her some depth - with the history of her parents and connection to her sister - but she focused SO much on her sexuality that it muffled all the rest. And Bo was little more than a cardboard cutout of hunky male yumminess. Again, I like me some hot male vamp, but if it's the only aspect of him we really see, it makes it hard to see him as a full person. And this was particularly jarring during a scene at the end, when he seemed to do a complete about face from tall, blonde, sexy, and mysterious to earnest family man wannabe.Ah, but I said MOST notably. I had other issues as well. Personally, I think this book would've benefited from some critical editing - not to fix errors, but to pare down and streamline the story itself. I felt the beginning, pre-Elena finding out about vampires, went on far too long. I also think what started as a shiny glitter of amusing and quirky characters dragged straight into repetition and ended up bordering tedium. Detective Dirk, for example, started out as a cute character and quickly got on my nerves real fast. As did Elena's fleeing from him. In fact, I'd say overall I would've preferred a bit more focus on character development and the relationship between Elena and Bo, and there would've been plenty of room for that if everything that happened 3-4 times (or more) in the book had been pared down to 1-2 times (including evading Detective Dirk, confrontations with Elena's sister, descriptions of every nuance of Bo's body, and the many many reminders of how long it'd been since Elena had last had sex). Also, I had one other slightly odd issue that I can't remember having in the many paranormal romance/urban fantasy series I read. I thought the vampire mythos in this book was a bit vague and anorexic in definition. What WAS there SEEMED sort of new and potentially fresh, but there really was so little explained, and most of that not even by an actual vampire, that I couldn't quite sink my teeth into it (pun intended). The lack left that aspect of the world far less clear in my mind than the setting, and as it's a vampire paranormal, I think that's a problem.All that being said, I did like the book and I'm going to be readingBiting Nixie: A Biting Love Novel, which, if I understand correctly, was the first book published, but the second in the timeline of the Biting Love series. I may be wrong about that, though - I'm a bit confused on the point - so don't quote me."
1300,4,The story definitely had intrigue and suspense.  I enjoyed it and would be interested in seeing the story developed into a full-length book.
1301,2,"this book was very disappointimg.  i thougt i would be readimg and intriguingly witty book, definitely not the case.  after the first story i could no longer torcher myself with reading the other 3 stories.  thank God the bloody book for free bcuz it was utter rubbish."
1302,5,I know it was a great love story but can't give much details cause I read it last month sometime.  But finished it in 2 days so you know it was a great romance story.
1303,2,"******SPOILER ALERT*******This is my second HKW book after ""Hell Bent"".  I understand ""The Chosen Soul"" was HKW's first book written some 10 years ago, and that it was revised by the author after reading some of the reviews.  Well, I think it might have needed a second revision.First off, let me say the author writes very well in general.  She also is highly imaginative and her action/battle scenes are exciting. As I'm still fairly new to the Fantasy Genre, it did take me a few chapters to immerse myself in the world setting.  As in ""Hell Bent"" I felt the situations were reasonably complex and the characters numerous.  It took me a while to sort everything and everyone out.  In fact, by the 40% mark (no page numbers on Kindle) I found myself growing confused about the three male love interests, mixing them up to such an extent that I had to go back to re-establish their identities.  They were all wonderfully handsome, had numerous magical powers, hypnotic eyes and all of them fell heavily for Raven/Winter.  That became a problem for me as the story progressed.  I got a little tired of all the handsome men wanting her so badly.The next problem for me was our heroine, Raven/Winter, herself.  She was kinda wimpy right up to the very end of the book.  I'm sure that finding out your father is a devil would be a shock, as would realizing you have demonic powers of your own.  But when your life, or those of your loved ones are threatened repeatedly (and I do mean, repeatedly, as in everyone is out to kidnap or rape you over and over again), then own those powers and use them to save yourself, woman!  Can't just stand on those exceptional good looks.Full points for the many great plot twists.  However, at one crucial point about 60-70% along, I must have been distracted and missed an important point.....that Cruor was Gray Beard!  Boy, I felt dumb over that one when I had to go back a few chapters to sort it out.  It threw me off that the character was called by both names later on in the narrative.On the whole, the plot was a little disjointed, but the individual plot ideas & inventions were interesting and imaginative.  I liked some of the characters a lot, like Loki and Abonides.  I found the names a little bit difficult at first but got used to it by the end.Perhaps, ultimately a bit dark in tone, and I do agree with other reviewers that the novel ended abruptly, like ""time to wrap this up now and finish up in a sequel some day"".  Raven/Winter didn't win points by resigning herself to life with the Elven Prince, but I guess she was just being practical since Drake was gone.  She was probably tired after fighting off all her abductors and needed a good rest.I will be reading the author's other books as I bought them all, they were such a good price.  But I do hope they will be a more satisfying read than ""The Chosen Soul"" was.June 9, 2011 - Edited typos."
1304,4,"Muller is like many heroes written during this period, smarter than most people. That's a bit of a drawback, but the stories are well-constructed, pace well, and the writing style is quite good apart from the typical verbosity of this era of writing. I recommend the book highly as good entertainment.  --Dr. William H. Stephens, retired editor"

1307,5,"Madeline `Maddie' Jones may not be `head over heels' for her boyfriend Gabe but she's certainly more than satisfied with their sexual relationship.  Leaving him never once entered her thoughts.  However when she meets Gabe's best friend, Connor, she's torn between the attraction she feels toward him and the already structured relationship she shares with Gabe.Connor Regan and Gabriel Carter have shared their women several times over the years.  Neither of them sees any foreseeable problem with sharing Maddie - especially since her playful demeanor and body's reactions show that she is attracted to both men.What none of them could have guessed is that the attraction between Connor and Maddie is more than just physical.  She shares an emotional bond with him that she's never felt with Gabe but that doesn't change the facts that she is Gabe's girlfriend.  She doesn't realize the closeness Gabe and Connor share or their commitment to the strict rules they abide by when they share a woman.Maddie gets her one night of m&eacute;nage-a-trois sex but when it comes down to it she wants more.  Connor isn't about to hurt his friend by stealing `his girl' and he certainly can't admit to his love for Maddie.  When all is said and done, Maddie, Connor and Gabe will be forced to choose whether to gamble everything on their feelings.  Do they walk away from what could inevitably be the love of their lives?  And if they choose to gamble what happens with their friendship?Jess Dee delves into the complications that could occur if close personal friends engage in a m&eacute;nage-a-trois relationship.  Maddie, Connor and Gabe enter into their m&eacute;nage with a lighthearted, fun mentality but at some point a unique connection is made and friendships and hearts could easily be shattered.  I love how Ms. Dee doesn't sugarcoat the situation and seems to effortlessly let it play out between the characters.  Tears, anger, hurt, love and understanding all combine to create a storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out what will happen next.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
1308,4,Stories were good but seemed to rush the relationship development between characters. That being said the story lines were good and the descriptions of the scenery and town were perfect! I enjoyed the books.
1309,5,I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book.  The plot was unusual.  Don't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me.
1310,4,"I totally enjoyed this story!  I get a little frustrated with all the comments about editing during reviews, maybe we should start critiquing the art work on the cover next.  The reason I read reviews is to see if the novel will be interesting to read.  We are all very fortunate these days to have the excitement of e-books and indie authors.  This means that we get the freshness of new authors, some of them so determined to get their story out that they will type it out on a phone.  That is just so cool to me.  Big deal, there are a few typos, a few misspelled words,  (probably from auto editing, which I love to hate) but the main thing is the STORY!  This is a good one, I would probably give this book 5 stars, except it reviewed for 3 when I read it, and the next book in this trilogy is rated a 4.5, the third a 5, I want to have some where to go.  Times like these I wish there were 10 stars to review with.The story was fantastic, the characters were great, and the plot was very creative.  This is a really enjoyable book.  I don't really get why some people rated it so low.  What is not to like?  The main character is a nice likeable guy,  and the rest of his crew are good people too.  The bad guys, well some are truely bad, there are some not as bad, bad guys too. The plot can seem pretty simple at first, but like all good books, the plot swells & grows as time passes.  I would feel that any zombie lover would be missing out if they didn't read this book, I am so excited about the next 2 that I already bought them both.Read this book, you will absolutely be glad you did!"
1311,5,"I just love Bella and Zsadist! I just wanna bottle them up and never let them go. After six books, I still look forward to the two of them the most. If my pure love for them wasn't enough, add those scorching sex scenes and you got a banger baby!!I love how this story focused solely on them. With exception for the chapter that gave us a brief view on the Doc, it was all Z and Bella with Nalla. They are the cutest little family, and who would have thought that Z would have been the first to carry on the line of Aghony and the aristocrats? Not me!It was like watching Z and Bella fall in love again. It also gave us an update and dose of reality as to where Z is in his recovery. He's not as far as I suspected at the end of 'Lover Awakened'.  He s struggling and with even more baggage.Even though Mary has paled quite considerably since 'Lover Eternal', the brothers never take a weak female. As such, it's good to see the fruits of Mary's labour and I always love it when she and Z get together. Whether learning or therapy, those two got a rhythm that no one else has with Z, not even Bella. Maybe it's her training, but Mary definitely knows how to handle him.I don't know T.W. and we might never see him again, but I love the man and what he stands for. His moment with his wife was precious, and was a slice of life outside of the supernatural, something that has been missing and slipping as this series grow.An update was also provided on the other members of the brotherhood, however minimal. Phury is back how I remember and respect him, even if he isn't fighting, and it was good to get back out in the field with the brothers. Their tactics and battles always fascinated and intrigued me. I loved 'Dark Lover' where we got more fighting than romance. There was plotting, scheming and failure. I secretly would have liked at least some action from Mr. D, but then again, this novel was about love, reconciling and building new bridges.I searched without seeing a book for Nalla, but I already love the young and anticipate spending time with her uncle Rehvenge in the next novel. Hopefully we get some more Bella and Z time from this, however small :)"
1312,5,I fell in love with Jane Porter and couldn't wait to be educated myself. Enter into a world where being a submissive is an honor most women crave and being tutored at the hands of Doms is a priceless gift.I was spellbound from the beginning.
1313,3,Short and sweet and doesn't pretend to be any more than it is so overall this was an ok read.  Would I read more?  Probably not!  I like a little more depth with the sex but then again it was written well and easy to read.
1314,4,Charity loves Gabriel and has for years. After one bad night 8 years earlier both have backed of but neither of them have stopped wanting one another. Gabriel believes that what he would demand of Charity would drive her away and he would rather be her friend then not have her in his life at all. Charity is sure Gabriel is holding back but she is sick of waiting for him to decide what kinda girl she is. She is going all out to get her man if only once she has him she can hold him. Gabriel can see Charity as a good girl who deserves marriage the white picket fence and the whole nine yards but he is sure he isn't the man to give her those things because once she sees all of him she will run. It is funny to watch a grown man run from what he truly wants and a woman man up to go after her man. Great read
1315,4,Hard to put it down! Now I can't wait to read the next story!!! I have been reading books out of order! What is the next book???
1316,5,"It is difficult for our generation to fully realize what slave life was like, but these first-person memoirs are so vivid and without rancor I was often in tears and so ashamed that some of my ancestors owned slaves.  It is heartbreaking that we could be so inhumane and call ourselves good people.  Man's inhumanity to man is chilling.  If you value true southern history, these slave narratives are for you."
1317,4,HEHEHE this book for me was crazy but in a good way intense. I loved it great read

1321,4,"One word that describe this story... HOT!I am a huge fan of Vivian Arend's Granite Lake Werewolves series and was really excited when she sent me this other one of hers. Specially since it is about a new sort of shifter and from the blurb I could see that a lot of hotness was to be had heheThe Forces of Nature is about Merfolk, men and women that shift into dolphins. How freaking cool is that? I love dolphins and it was great to read about a different kind of mythology, ona that I hadn't seen before.Tidal Wave tells the story of Alexia, who doesn't know she is part of a merfolk clan, but when she goes help out her supposedly senile Grandmother, finds out that not only she is a dolphin shifter but she is set to be the next clan leader.The proximity to the sea and the clan start affecting her hormones and giving out signs to the single males of the clan. She need to choose one or more to help her body get the hormones she needs to be able to shift.When you think nothing can be sexier than a Hot dolphin shifter, you realize that reading about Alexia's budding relationship with Joshua and Anthony definitely puts you your place.I have to say, WOW! Tidal Wave brought out the HOT and got me all hot and bothered. I literally blushed at times and had to take a little brake.If you enjoy Paranormal Erotica, you really need to check this series out! The second book, ""Whirlpool"" comes out in August, and I'll be reading and reviewing it soon =)Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}"
1322,5,"Julia Savage is damned good at bluffing - and it's definitely served its purpose at the weekly poker games she plays with her friends and fellow card players Hunter Miles and Jay Baxter.  She's been able to bluff at cards, but more importantly she's been able to hide her true feelings for Hunter and Jay.  Picking one man over the other is impossible and something she's not even willing to attempt to do - so instead she'll continue to pretend they're nothing but flirtatious friends.Hunter and Jay have teased and tempted Julia to the point where they're so sexually frustrated they're having a hard time keeping their emotions under control.  Neither of the men considered sharing her but it seems they might have better odds if they double down.  While Jay is a clown and constantly joking and sporting a silly grin, Hunter is more serious and focused.  The combination between the two of them is lethal to Julia's overactive libido.Admittedly succumbing to Hunter and Jay's advances is a temptation but even their intoxicating kisses isn't enough to incite Julia to choose one man over the other - and there's the little issue of if she does enter into a m&eacute;nage relationship with them how will she ever introduce them to her parents?  Julia's a good girl - and good girls don't engage in risqu&eacute; activities - or at least that's what she was led to believe.  One thing's certain; the relationship between the three of them will forever be altered, but when everybody involved is willing to go all in, the loving will definitely be worth it.Somehow poker never seemed like a sexy pastime but Jess Dee might have just changed my mind with GOING ALL IN.  The verbal sparring between Julia, Hunter and Jay is more akin to foreplay and definitely caught my attention. I really love how Hunter and Jay join forces rather than try to make Julia choose between them - and in the end it's obvious that the three of them really do belong together.  Ms. Dee melds scorching hot sex scenes with believable emotional situations for a read that's satisfying and will have you wanting more.Be sure to check out the other titles in Jess Dee's THREE OF A KIND series:Raising the Stakes (Three of a Kind)Full House (Three of a Kind)Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"

1324,4,"This fantasy mystery story moves at a YA pace, but it's about a woman with teen sons, who is trying to figure out why her husband disappeared. The plot is tight and well focused. The characters are well drawn. And there's enough information about how the magic system works that the reader can figure out both mysteries in the story, which is hard to do in fantasy."
1325,5,I AM SO GLAD I PURCHASED THIS BOOK AND I HAD 2HOURS OF PLEASURE WHILE READING IT.
1326,5,"I loved this book, I loved that characters were imperfect, I loved chemistry between them, but the main reason I am writing here is because I wanted to share just how much I hated one of the characters (not sure if it was desired effect or not, but hey one cannot help how one feels). Please feel free to stop reading, since it is sort of a rant that book just made me think of, it has nothing to do with the merits of the story, or maybe it does  have something to do with author's writing talent, since it invoked such strong feelings in me and only a good writer can do it  :).I hated Jae's editor, but hey I am biased, I have no relation to any celebrities, gay or straight lol, but I despise tabloid journalism, I despise it with passion. I think that even celebrity has their right to privacy and the person who destroys it is a vulture. But I warned you, I despise tabloid journalism, I am not interested in celebrities' marriages, divorces, affairs, etc, I know a lot of people eat this stuff with the spoon, I just really ignore these magazines.SPOILERS to follow, even though very minor ones, since the names of the characters which I am referring to are not the names of two lead characters.So since I happen to think that what happened to Hunter is completely a fault of this guy and his magazine, well, I was ready to slap Vega when he went into his self righteous rant about people like Hunter hurting people.Anyway, great story, thank you!"
1327,5,"Christopher Pinckley has written a step by step guide to becoming who you want to be.  The first part of the book involves the steps required to learn or decide what or who you want to be.  This is not as easy as it seems.  So many of us get into the flow of our lives and never really stop to analyze what it is that we want.  This in depth look at what we want is very important if we are to manifest ourselves and become what we want.  The second step involves getting rid of the barriers that we all carry as baggage that prevent up from becoming what we dream of becoming and the last step involves getting to where we want to be.The author has been where most of us start.  He did not know who he was or who he wanted to become.  He had these ill defined goals and he had plenty of baggage preventing him from realizing even these ill defined goals.  Having been there, he can better guide us through these processes.The book is broken down into easy to read chapters and I was surprised at the practical exercises that he gives to make it easy to get from one step to another.  Without these concrete exercises this book might just be another ""go our and realize your dream"" books.  There is much more than that here.This book is a good read for people of all ages even if you think that you have found what you want and are already there.  Looking into our desires is a compelling and interesting exercise, no matter how old or successful we think that we are."
1328,4,"This was a pretty good short story.I found myself laughing and yelling at the book during different scenes. I love 'take charge, sexually aggressive men' and Milo is it. I couldn't help but wonder if Maya truly deserved him. I'm not going to give you a synopsis, but I will say that its the typical office romance where mis-communication causes people to act like fools. Although the story was mighty short, I was still entertained. And, the sex scenes were great. Who doesn't like those uninhibited, freeing, honest sexual experiences? Good god... I remember being reckless. LOL Anywayyy... it's a fun, fast read. So, for less than $2, you can't go wrong."
1329,1,If you like period pieces you might like this but I honestly couldn't finish the book.  To annoying and completely unbelieveable.
1330,5,"I love romances that are ""real"" and this one is so very real. The characters are not larger than life, they have pasts, things they regret and dreams they have forgotten. They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other, their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book, it was beautiful, sweet, sad in places and oh ever touching, watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life."
1331,5,This is book 2 of this super love story series set in the mountains of Arizona.  This author is fantastic and I am enjoying reading more of her books.  You will not be able to put them down once you get started.
1332,5,This is a somewhat gruesome thriller that was a page turner from beginning to end.  It kept me thinking about the whole storyline for hours after I finished reading.  Good Book!!
1333,4,"Callie grew up with a family of friends that happen to be witches. But there is someone killing witches, so the family does a spell on her to make her appear to be a witch. So they can catch the killer."
1334,5,I read this book several months ago and forgot to review it then. I have read about ten different books similar to this one since then. I dont think I will ever read one any better than Phoebe Deane. I wish I could be as sweet and brave and caring as she is.
1335,5,"Rachel has come back to Cougar Falls in search of a new beginning. The legacy from her beloved Aunt Charlotte couldn't have come at a more fitting time.Burke Chastell just wants Rachel to collect her inheritance and sell him the land so they can find the totem that protects Cougar Falls before the rest of the world discovers not only that it exists, but all of its secrets.Rachel's Totem by Marie Harte is HOT!  I enjoyed this story more than expected. Since it is part of an ongoing series, I was afraid I would be lost and confused, but I wasn't. I had no problem following the story and motivations of the characters. There was an unexpected m&eacute;nage, but it was definitely a fun one. I will be checking out more of Ms. Harte's stories after this one.Elysiareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1336,5,I loved and thoroughly enjoyed this book. I think Elle Kennedy is a great writer and I look forward to a new book.
1337,4,"This is a good protector while transporting your Kindle DX.  It is not something you can keep on it while reading it, though.  The zipper opens this sleeve 50 percent and can be kept on the device while it is charging.The biggest negative about this product is the price.  I bought this sleeve for my Kindle DX when Amazon featured it as a lightning deal for under twenty bucks.  But even at that price this is overpriced because Belkin makes a sleeve just like this for Apple iPads for under ten bucks.  Why the gross price increase for this one when both are so similar in size?All that aside, this is well-made and fits my DX nicely with very little wiggle room.  It provides good padding and grip, as all Belkin laptop sleeves do, and is ideal for carry-on travel or as protection for the Kindle DX while in a backpack or portfolio case.  But there's not much more room for anything inside this sleeve as there are no other pockets, so placing the recharging cord requires a tight roll.The gross overprice takes a star off an otherwise very good product.Edit 28 May 2011:  I see the price dropped from a ridiculous $44 to a more reasonable $29, but this is still almost $20 more than the just-a-tad smaller iPad cover of the same design."
1338,5,"I have an illustration to describe what a good job Jules Verne did: My husband, who is dislexic, does not prefer reading as pleasure at all. We read together (me reading aloud) all the time. However, with The Mysterious Island, I couldn't tear him away from it! He downloaded it onto his phone so that he could read in his spare time. It's a breakthrough, folks! Excellent, exciting, educational read."
1339,5,I think my last charger burned up my kindle.  this one charges fast like 1/2 hour.  dosen't seem to get hot.  hope it last a long time.
1340,5,"Now that I am old, I still enjoy Andre Norton.  I cannot seem to tell you why but I just do."
1341,4,These stories kept my attention and were hard to put down.  The author weaves a tale that helps you develop a kinship with the characters in this fantastical world.
1342,5,"I love all of Linda Howard book. I esspecally love Machenzie's Magic. You will too. Just read one, you'll too."
1343,4,"I love books in a series. Again we have dominate male, strong but submissive female. The twist in this alien romance is the male is human-a strong human and the female is half human. Of course there is intrigue, this time from trusted guards, but the danger is continued from book one. The same villain, different ship and different characters."
1344,4,"The concept behind this story was truly 'out there'. I like stories with an unusual twist, so i enjoyed this book. I can see why others wouldnt though. i recommend it to those who dont take their stories too seriously. They should make this a new genre for those who like their steamy tales with a bizzaro twist."
1345,3,"Another well written eBook by Troy Denning, but why is it put where it is? Why not a part of Balance Point? It is well written and belongs in the new Jedi Order. I just don't think it should stand alone. It is fun and fast to read on my Kindle, but not even in paperback????"
1346,5,"The whole series is a very good read, sexy, and with a code of honor and great moral compass. I have read 11-15 and 1-5, I can't wait for more Westmorlands."
1347,3,"PLOT: Hospital cafeteria worker Zandrea first bumps into Brant in the ER. He's injured and bleeding but he leaves without receiving treatment. She sees him soon after at a club and his injuries are healed. Brant overhears her discussing him with her friends. He approaches her with the intentions of having his brother erase her memories of him. But something about her calls to his nature and the evening does not go exactly as he planned. He knows that he cannot be without her.PROS: The author weaves a good plot. The love scenes between Zan and Brant are hot.CONS: The character development could be better. We know very little about Zan and Brant. Zan came off as only being immature. When she met Brant, she was hanging out in the ER for a chance to meet a doctor. That's just wrong.Much of the middle of the book they spend separated since Zan has forgotten him. So at the end when they get their ""happy ever after,"" it's not so believable that she loves him and vice versa.It's a minor issue but it speaks to the plausibility of the plot; Zan never actually see's Brant's injury. She sees blood seeping through his shirt. Since she doesn't know how serious his injury was, there's no reason for her to question it and no reason for him to go after her.3 STARS: I gave it three stars since it is an interesting start to a series. It has peaked my interest enough that I'd like to finish the trilogy."
1348,4,"This was a sexy, SEXY read - great descriptions without being lame or gross. The story was a bit hokey (that's why four stars instead of five) but the sex scenes made me tingle. Highly recommend this!"
1349,5,Simply well done!!! Thank you for combining erotica and romance in such an awe inspiring way. I'm looking forward to reading your other books. I hope they are just as rewarding as this one was.
1350,5,"I haven't read this whole series. I only read Zsadist's story, Lover Awakened, and became enthralled by him. I fell in love with his character. In fact, the entire reason I'm not going back to read the rest of the series is the way the author tells the story--there were so many other points of view in Zsadist's book that I felt it took away from the true romance being told. It appears to be her style and the book's not a romance, so there's nothing wrong with it. It just isn't for me. So, when I found out about this book, I had to have it. I adored this book. I loved getting the deeper look into him and I loved having that final closure for him, watching him truly heal from his wounds. Very sweet book. If you read any of this series, read Zsadist. This is a hero who will be with me for a long time. She told his story with an almost eerie realism that only made me fall in love with him. The wounded hero. Love love love it. Highly reccomend this one."
1351,4,"I believe it is even harder to write a good short story or novella than a full length novel. The restraint of space in which to develope characters, pen a plot, cause a conflice and resolve it are limited to say the least.  This author is brilliant at it.  I can't wait to read more of his work."
1352,4,"Loved the story, characters were well rounded and believable. We all should have a Grandmother like the one in this story! I felt it was quite heartwarming. The love scenes were steamy!! You will NOT be disappointed, plus a delicious recipe at the end!"
1353,4,"Great characters, realistic within the sci fi bounds. Good story line and decent editing. I really liked this. Action, and not boring during down time."
1354,4,"This second book was good to read and had alot of stories for each person involved. The excitement grew with each page. It had warmth,sadness and surrprise. Some of the characters reations were alittle unreal and shouldn't have accepted situtations that happened so easily, but this is a fiction book and was well written in my opinion. I will be starting book three shortly and hope it is as good as the first two books."
1355,1,"This just wasn't a great read at all. J.L. Langley has been a favorite author of mine since I read Without Reservations and I expected His Convenient Husband to be just as good, but it wasn't. While I might not be completely into the cowboy trope like the other readers I have enjoyed it on occasion (so it's not that), but this one just felt like a cliched, by-the-numbers plot. It lacked any kind of interesting qualities and missed the sexual chemistry between Micah and Tucker by a mile. I like her other books immensely, but this will be quickly forgotten for her other entertaining books."
1356,5,"This second book in the series is as good as the first . You can't get enough of the world of dragons, if you love romance and dragons then this work of art is for you. The only way you could go wrong would be to miss this set . The books draw you in and are impossible to put down . WOW !!!!! For this work of dragons !!!"
1357,5,I really like Jennifer Crusie's writing and have enjoyed several of her books.  Her sense of humor is wonderful and refreshing.
1358,5,"This is the second book that I've read from Rebecca Forster.  What can I say?  She's done it again!  I loved this book.Rebecca Forster's novel, Before Her Eyes, draws you in from the very beginning and keeps building momentum.  This book walks you beautifully through a murder investigation and the hunt for a missing woman.  While following the investigation, we get insight into what the missing woman is going through in first person dialog that kept me intrigued throughout the book.  I also really liked the back story for each of the characters, and how it affects them and others throughout the story Rebecca is telling.  WAIT UNTIL YOU READ THE ENDING!  There are some surprises in store.  This is a must read."
1359,5,"Romantic, red hot Latin lover !!! Wow.  She's a lucky gal! Eden Bradley writes great romance, erotic, loving, sincere stories. This includes a night with Rafael's best friend. Very erotic.  But they must decide if their passionate reunion is simply a celebration of the past...or a new beginning for lasting love.Torrid romance, deep feelings, hot sex, great scenes and good atmosphere. You, the reader, fell as though you understand them and want it to work out.  Love her work."
1360,5,"Although dated as far as language and technology is concerned, this is an excellent compilation of short stories and longer works.  Based in England, there is a British bent to the stories.  I read this book in between longer works as a change of pace."
1361,4,Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com.
1362,5,I love anything written be President Monson and this book was no exception.  It has a permanent place in my library.
1363,4,The Haircut is a captivating story that contains all the elements of a finely tuned fairy tale. This is a lovely story full of good and evil with twists and turns that will intrigue and capture your heart.Tasha enlists the help of her cousin and closest friend Gregori to find a barber to cut off all her hair in a last minute attempt to halt a pre-arranged wedding to a man who has a perverted attachment to her long beautiful hair. She has been under the care of the Count and Countess who have arranged the marriage for their own monetary gain. They stumble upon Mike a barber who is resistant to do as she asks yet is persuaded by her persistence. Upon returning to her home she is brutally beaten for her actions and Gregori takes it upon himself to get them out of their situation and enlists the help of Mike.Tasha is a character that is vulnerable yet wise. Despite the unfair and cruel situation she has been placed in she maintains her sense of hope and her belief of the Angel of New Years. She is a character that will pull capture your heart.Mike is a barber who lost his wife during child-birth and has a daughter he is raising while living with his mother. He has been isolating himself from the outside world but all that changes when Tasha comes into his life.The characters in this story are very well defined and are the very essence of this story. The author takes great care in defining the characters with depth and compassion. Each character adds a tremendous attention to detail as their stories are revealed and play an essential part in the story.I enjoyed this book very much and could feel the sense of hope and happiness that was conveyed.
1364,5,you'll get a bang out of this book  as the old west comes alive with all the gunfighterslots of interesting story's  I really enjoyed this book
1365,4,"From one page to the next Youngin is filled with the twists, betrayal and hustle of the street life. I can't wait to jump into the continuing saga."
1366,5,"Not the best title, but that was deceiving. I really really really enjoyed this story and if that makes me strange. Bring on the therapy. Well done. AGAIN."
1367,5,this was different and new to me. it was a very good and cute story in it's own way. I won't lie it was a little bridle at parts not for the faint of heart but a good read
1368,1,"The story is told from a very provincial perspective: that if the New York City Jewish community in 1969 and supposedly 40 years latter. I say ""supposedly"" because I'm 12% into this story and about to give up.  It's very boring."
1369,5,If you have read none of the Primal Instinct  books I would tell you start with this one. It will give you a good layout of the stories to come I read this near the end of the serious and have told friends to start here and work through the set which all have
1370,5,"too short would have wanted more development in the story , because of the length , no preamble, no real build up for the duo, more on the sub-plot !!!  just more ...  I will read the rest of the series"
1371,5,This was a nice and wonderful little story. I truly enjoyed reading this book and would not have minded another little book with more on their happily ever after. Definitely well worth the read.
1372,4,"This was a great value for the first three novels in the Lady Julia Grey series.Silent in the Grave - To be honest, it took me about 2/3 of this book to really get into it.  When I did though, I could not stop reading.  I liked the character of Julia and I am interested to find out more about Brisbane.  I think switching from UF to this book, more of a historical mystery, was a little jarring and that is why it took me a bit to get into it.  The writing is well done, and while the story is a little slower paced at the beginning, it really picks up at the end and left me wanting more.  Since this was the three-book bundle, I jumped right into the second book!Silent in the Sanctuary - I liked this book more than the first.  The mystery was a bit more interesting and I felt that the pace was a little quicker, which I liked.  Julia and Brisbane continue to be an intriguing pairing and I can't wait to find out more about them.  I really enjoyed the secondary characters in this novel.  I loved the time we spent with Julia's family, especially Portia, and friends.  Fleur is the best.  Morag and Aquinas are also great.  Hopefully Aquinas will be around a little bit more in the next book.  All in all, this is a series I am glad I was introduced to and that I plan to continue reading.Silent on the Moor - I enjoyed this book a little less than the second, but probably as much as the first.  The mystery was a little less important this time around and the pace a little slower, but we did get to meet some interesting new characters.  I really loved Rosalie and how the story of Brisbane's early years turned out.  The Allenbys were one messed up family.  Julia was adorable as always and I loved to see her holding her own with Brisbane even more.  The location descriptions were suitably creepy and I liked the inclusion of the egyptology subplot.  All in all a solid entry into this series and I am eager to see what effect the ending of this book has on the final two novels."
1373,4,i thoroughly enjoyed reading the book called Two Sighted. It was a very easy read and a lot of fun.
1374,5,Love this series and only wish this book had been longer.  P.C. Cast is quickly becoming my favorite author of all time.
1375,5,"Wow!  This is Book 2 of The Realm Shift Trilogy (Book 1 is The REALM SHIFT) and picked up seamlessly where book one left off.  Another fast-paced, wonderfully depicted story of the continuing battle between good and evil, as well as personal and spiritual growth.  The action never stopped!  If you like stories with ships, cannons, swords and castles,...read this series.I felt like I was on a rollercoaster...the ending leaving you hovering at the top of the ride, waiting for the next book to take you over the top.  Can't wait until book 3 is published! Great read!"
1376,5,"This was a really interesting book. I read a lot of short erotica books but this one was more the proper erotica romance that deserves a review. Despite the short length of the book (85 pages), the characters were developed enough to get an idea of one part of their lives.Bev and Holden had a big misunderstanding a few years ago and Bev had been avoiding Holden since then. When a wise mutual friend decided that things needed a little nudge, not only Bev and Holden, but the rest of their circle of friends, they all received a pleasant gift from the birthday boy, Shane. They were instructed to share the gift with the person that Shane assigned them to. It was basically a matchmaking fiasco. Everyone was upset and walked out of the party.Bev and Holden were the last one to go. Before Bev could leave, Holden cornered her and demanded to know why she had been avoiding him all these years. Long story short, they ended up in the bedroom and admitted love for each other.This book was well-written with minimal to no errors and absolutely amazing chapters. I can't wait to read the rest of this series!"
1377,5,"Enjoyed reading this book,  Robert Vaughan is on my list as a must read author.  Lots of action and was well written"
1378,2,"This one got mixed reviews, but I figured what the heck, it's free. Im not through the first chapter yet and im not sure i want to read more.  It's not horrible. Believe it or not I've actually read worse. But the author does a large amount of telling instead of showing. For example, Ty will often tell us how Gwen was feeling rather than the author showing us through Gwen's actions and expressions. Typical beginning writer mistakes. The characters as well were unfortunately cardboard cut outs, and some of their actions poorly motivated, IOW unbelievable. No chemistry between the characters either. Unfortunately I won't be looking for anymore of this author's works. Had I paid for this, I'd feel cheated."
1379,3,"I chose this rating a good book for younger people.I liked the story, it's a series you have to read next book to see what happens.Will refer."
1380,2,"The premise of this book is a pretty good one:  bioterrorism coming from a disenfranchised segment of our own population.Unfortunately, that's as good as it gets.  The books randomly wanders backward in time.  The ""hero"" of the book is primarily stuck emotionally as a teenager.  He calls the prison office manager mom, and he talks and thinks about girls like a chaste fifteen-year-old (except during the flashbacks).The point of view changes from person to person, and without notice.  Everyone's thoughts, including a chemist and high-level alphabet agency personnel, are immature and remarkably random.  There's gratuitous sex, and by that I mean that a main character picks up a girl in a strip joint and abuses her, badly.  It's not too graphic, but it has nothing to do with the story, except to make it more obvious that the character's a bad guy.  I like sex in my books, but this was just totally unnecessary to the plot, and the scenes felt like afterthoughts.  Next time, author?  Just leave them out unless they serve a purpose.The chemist is a Vietnam veteran, and his first experience with The Wall is poignant and touching and probably the best part of the entire book.The case is solved, singlehandedly, by the ""hero,"" who happens upon boxes full of current network information for a major chemical company.  Yeah, because some major American corporation is going to just print out usernames and passwords, toss the papers into boxes and send them to the recycler.  Said recycler just happens to be a prisoner who mines all that information to snoop on the company's network and outfox everybody, including a CIA agent.  I suspended my disbelief for the duration of the book, because many things were implausible, even to my non-secret-agent knowledge.Once the case is solved and the bad guys are caught in the act, the book ends.  Fffffft!  No loose ends tied up, no resolution for any of the characters, just done.  Buh-bye.Bottom line is, I could have enjoyed this book, and have enjoyed others which presented similar theorems.  Instead, I was relieved to get to the end of the book, so I could move on to something else."
1381,4,This was an excellent read. I was caught up in it on the very first page. Loved it.  It bothers me that I have to write a. Retain number of words in order to submit a review.
1382,5,"This is a great book, has a little of everything, mystery, love, gaining self confidence. This book in my opinion is a must read."
1383,3,Maya Banks is one of my favorite writers but this particular book just didn't do much for me.  The idea was a good one but the whole plot seemed to jump around too much.  First they don't or won't be together and then suddenly with little or no information given to the reader they are together big time.  I just felt it was no on the normal high level of this author's previous books.  Absolutely still a huge fan!
1384,5,St.John's story is a great close to the series. Found the Inconvenient Duchess for free quite a while ago. I've now read most if Ms. Merrill's books. She's quite a good writer. I highly recommend this series.
1385,5,A good read with a strong character. The ending proved to be a little far-fetched  but definitely a good read!
1386,4,Not one for lengthy reviews so BLUF:Good read for moms who like to share books with their teens.. Like the storyline different that the usual vampire theme still going. LOVE the characters especially a strong young woman role. Loved this book and hope that the next book is as good!

Alex knows her stuff, and breaks it down step by step by step until it makes sense.  For the first time in a long time, my fingers are actually aching to hit the keys.There are two books that are now and forever a part of my Writer's Library:  ON WRITING by Stephen King, and SCREENWRITING TRICKS FOR AUTHORS by Alexandra Sokoloff."
1388,4,"Very Interesting. Looked at the situation from many different angles. Well written & would recommend to others. The author has a good writing technique, will read more by him."
1389,4,Stay with me was worth its price. But you must like menege stories. The guys Rhys and Logan are clueless as to what is expected in a committed relationship and keep putting Catherine as the bottom of their to-do list which makes her rethink the relationship. I've read the book twice and its a keeper
1390,4,"This was a great story, and now has me hooked on the author. Scary as all get out, and I read it in one sitting. Cannot beat the price either!"
1391,5,"great book, well written, good story line, great characters, kept me engaged, couldn't put it down, but way too short - would have loved this as a full length novel"
1392,5,"As always, Susan Mallery brings her characters to life!!  I always love her ability to draw you into a story right from the beginning!!!"
1393,5,I am reading the the book one and I sure this is just as good.  That's all I have to say.

1395,2,"This wasn't one of my favorite Maya Banks.  I was just not that into it.  The emotion was raw and really well written, but there was just too much of it.  It spilled over the pages of the books and left me feeling depressed by the end.  I didn't really understand the villains motivation he was just doing things to do them. And while the characters were well fleshed out I found myself not really liking them.  There was not enough lightness in the dialogue between them to actually get into the romance.  I kept hoping they would hook up just so the book would end. It just wasn't an enjoyable read.  Which is disappointing because I almost always love books by Maya Banks.  I would give this one a pass though."
1396,4,this book wasnt very long but very good ! great book to spend a few hours on the couch with
1397,4,"Personally I found this to be a very good read...I found myself laughing out loud several times...Not quite the typical shifter read, but very enjoyable ..."
1398,5,Exciting story full of twists and turns. It really showed differing viewpoints and positions related to slavery in the United States.
1399,3,I liked it because it was interesting and unexpected.It is not what you would expect from a Celtic tale. Nice change from my usual reading.

1401,4,"Note: This is the first book I've read from this author.This book had a good storyline and held my interest until the end. However there are parts not everyone would agree with. They seem more animal than human. Bruno has to kill the current alpha in order to gain contol of the pack. To really seal they're bond, Bruno and Renee have sex in shifted form. Not all readers would want to read this and I'm surprised that isn't in the product description. Also a HUGE element that took some getting used to: ALL the females were referred to as bitches, which goes back to them seeming more animal than human. I did like the book and I would not be opposed to reading another book from this series or this author."
1402,4,"The author definitely tried to write a good love story and I love a good love story. It was all there...handsome rich guy....poor beautiful girl from the other side of the tracks....obsessive father....weak mother. The problem with the book was the love story itself. Mac, the girl, is the most indescisive woman you will ever meet. She changes her mind so often, I was confused constantly. The story was also choppy and unbelieveable...this kind of stuff just doesn't happen to real people and it was hard to like the story. I did adore Dakota, even though he wasn't very real either. I had a hard time getting through all the love babble between Dakota and Mac...I just don't think people talk that way and that much about their feelings for one another....and then feel like it has to constantly be repeated. It was a good read, though."
1403,3,"I had not read a story of a survivor from Bialystok, Poland.  I had read previously read a story of a Rabbi from Bialystok, but he spent the war in Russia.  Therefore, this account was more descriptive of the cultural climate of the region.I am always amazed at how Holocaust victims survived the horrific events that were forced upon them.I will say that the formatting on the Kindle was not good.  If you are easily distracted by format issues, I would not recommend getting it on the Kindle."
1404,5,I love Michelle Sagara's Elantra series. I have read these books several times. I just can't get enough of these amazing characters & their worlds. Brilliant.
1405,1,"I'm torn between a 1star review, for the blurb not saying its paranormal, and a 4 star for hotness.The story is at a good price, it is hot, but the lack of a warning that it is paranormal story really annoyed me very much. It started off okay (the story about a conservative girl wanting to break out of her shell and get a tattoo; stopping at a tattoo shop and finding the tattoo dude like super hot) and then all of a sudden it took a sharp left turn off into La La land (talking about dragon protectors, mates, cr&egrave;ches Verikos, and Gemii's ... It was just weird) and seriously that drove me CRAZY!!!If you like paranormal, for a 1.50, you can't go wrong with this story.However if you're not a fan of paranormal STAY AWAY!!"
1406,2,"As erotica alone, it might delevers. Unfortunately the plot lacks logic to make the story worth following. I did follow though because the mystery was intriguing enough and really puzzled me but in the end a lot of scenes was not explained so it was a messy and loose story at best.***Spoiler***My biggest trouble is that the heroine dreams about or sense when the villain is on the move. It was never explained why she alone were able to and not the hunter who was centuries older than her or all the paranormal characters.If you are reading for the erotica alone this might work for you but if you want the story behind all the sex to make sense this book will missed it more than a mile wide."
1407,5,Very nice collection of the more well known works and a few of the lesser known.  A must have for the Vernies.  :o)
1408,2,"I love Gena's Lords series, but this one is not for me. I wasn't captivated by the world og the buildup."
1409,5,"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure, few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook, you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series, which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series, which includes Swords of Talera, Wings Over Talera, and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books, and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition."
1410,5,"great characters, good action, and fantastic science fiction.  my favorites are 4 day planet, lone star planet, and little fuzzy; all of which I can read anytime and never get tire of."
1411,1,"This writer seemed to know what he was doing, but he forgot one of the most important rules. The rule is show me, Don,t tell me. When someone describes a conversation instead of showing the conversation, you know the point has been missed. I couldn't get past the first few chapters."
1412,4,"I bought this book a couple of years ago, soon after I bought my Kindle and I have read it several times.  For me it's a keeper that I keep going back to in my Kindle ""Favorites"" collection.  Considering the book was fairly short, I think the author did an excellent job of developing Lark & Taran's characters and the sex scenes were smokin' hot.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the unfinished business with Nick & TJ.  They are secondary characters that practically beg for their own story and I've been anxiously waiting for their book, but at this point I don't expect Kinsey will ever get around to it."
1413,5,"This is a fascinating collection of collected stories, many different versions of one another. If you are interested in these fairytales, I would advise for you to get various published stories of the Brothers Grimm's tales."
1414,4,"I really enjoyed this short romance.Ainsley was running after her ex boyfriend attacked her. She knew she needed a place to stay to get out of the storm so she found a house that she thought was abandoned. She quickly found out the house belonged Braedan that was serving time. Most people thought he was serving time for a crime he didn't commit. She wanted to be out of the house before he got out of jail.  He got out early, and came home to the smell of apple pie, and a beautiful lady in his kitchen. It was sweet at how fast the two fell in love with one another.Some of my best parts from the book:Sample from chapter 3 - As the water washed over her, she wondered how she'd gotten herself into this mess. She was engaged to an ex-con, a man she'd never met before last night: she was on the run for murder and she was absolutely terrified.Sample from chapter 4""You would have been better off if I hadn't come here."" He put his fork down and turned her to face him. ""Don't ever think that. You took my house and made it into a home, Ainsley. I'd come back thinking I was going to walk into a house that was falling down. Instead I was welcomed by the smell of apple pie and the most delectable woman on earth in my kitchen."""
1415,5,Fun stories to read to my children.They are always asking me to read them a favorite from the book. Excellent writer Jacob Grimm. Every child should have someone read to them!
1416,5,"This is a great story set in a fantasy-world on Earth in the late 18th Century about a girl who after an embarrassing incident in front of the king her father chatises her so she runs away and stows away on a ship.  Except the ship she choose Captain is fer fathers rival and not one to take kindly to someone hiding out on his ship.  He knows just how to deal with bratty young ladies and proceeds to do just that many, many times as renny can't seem to keep herself out of trouble.  This book has a little bit of everything from adventure, intrigue and yes ramance and lots of spankings."
1417,5,I loved the wild uninhibited beginning to their story.  She realized how much was lacking from her almost fiance. That would have been tragic.
1418,5,"Michelle Willingham is a wonderful author of historical romance. I was captivated from the beginning. The romance, the strong spirited Hannah and the dangerous rake Michael wove a storyline of wonderment. Adding the mystery of who was the true Prince and if there was truly a switching of three-year old boys, then who was behind it all. High recommendations for this book go out to the readers of romantic novels."
1419,5,"I really enjoy shifter books.  This series has danger, mystery, and love ( but it is steamy not suitable for young readers.)"
1420,5,"I enjoy her books, a little predictable but enjoyable. She does a good job getting you invested in the characters and the story line. Yes, it is all about the sex!"
1421,5,"I just want to start by saying that I loved the characters in this book. Aidn and Bailey were both so realatable( is this a word?) Anyway.... Aidn was so hot and steamy, he was the main character of many of Bailey's hot, wet dreams! Who could blame her though really, he is one man I wouldn't mind to licking a little frosting off of! Ohhh LaLa!! But enough about my fantasies:) Bailey having left her husband for a life living the lifestyle of BDSM has not found the right dom for her, until she meets Aidn at the club. She just knows that he is the rigt Dom to make her submit like she has wanted for so long. She wants to be owned and willing to meet all of Aidns' needs. Athough Aidn had also seen Bailey at the club, she is not the typical girl that he would find sexy. She is not tall,slim or does she have long hair but he can't help that he has some real lust for her. He thinks she seems to shy and innocent for what he is really looking for. He has not had a successful D/s relationship and is hesitant to start one with Bailey but his body is telling him that he wants her collared and at his feet. Add in a little pink frosting into the mix and Voila, you have a delicious read!There story was sweet and sexy. My heart even skipped a couple of beats during this read. I fell in love with Bailey and Aidn and think that many others will do the same. It is a definite recomend and possible re-read. Which doesn't happen very often!!I give this book my hightest score of 5. I loved it!"
1422,5,"The Wings on the Night series is enchanting! This series was the series that led me to Maggie Shayne, who I adore. I fell in love with the vampires from her series & reading this collection only served to deepen that love! I own this entire series, but I jumped on the chance to own this collection on my Kindle app. Part one contains some of my favorite characters - Rihanna, Roland, Tamara, Eric, and list goes on and on! Grab this collection and step into the enchanting stories of the immortal vampire! Embrace the night & fall in love with these amazing characters!P.S. Maggie is getting read to return to these characters in a new series! Catch up one your reading while we wait For the new novels!"

1424,5,Good storyline...interesting plot...didnt like the ending but this leaves door open to a sequel...action-packef..great read.  Buy this book for some friend.
1425,5,This is another favor book of mine I like to read
1426,4,"I liked this book. Although I must say I did not understand what the big deal was with her so called ""secret"" that she did not want the hero to know but all and all I did enjoy this book and I felt like it ended well. Good read"
1427,5,"I really enjoyed this novel about a young man, his ""unique"" pet, and the fight with the town to be able to keep the pet. The book is well written, well thought out, and would enhance any young adult's library. It gets kids back to being kids, not vampires, not werewolves, just kids, pets, and baseball. I'd highly recommend it."
1428,5,"I have read all of J R Ward's books and this was a great follow up to the book of  Zsadist and Bella. Lots of action and sex with heartwarming story lines. I can't wait for "" Lover  at Last"" due out the end of March."
1429,3,"Contained in this Jennifer Cruise bundle:Getting Rid Of Bradley- 1.5 StarsLucy Savage just got divorced. Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blond bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.Across the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.Lucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to dye her hair. Blond was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.Today Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.What started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.Though I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.What really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.Unfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me.Strange Bedpersons- 3 StarsOriginally published in 1994, there's little about this quirky romance about the ladder-climbing yuppie Republican lawyer Nick and the hippie, commune-raised, militant-feminist liberal Tess that doesn't feel almost painfully dated. That being said, Crusie pens a fast-paced plot that delves more deeply than I'd anticipated into the potential disaster of a relationship between two people who love each other, but who are so different they will never see eye to eye.Nick, despite his career-loving little heart, is a fun character who is actually pretty forgiving and able to compromise, though he does have a rather vanilla predilection for sex in bed. He's pretty darn forgiving of some pretty radical behavior and recognizes before Tess does that some compromise is in order, yet he still manages to mess up a little as he presses his own sense of fashion off onto the bohemian Tess and tries to wear down some of her rougher edges before he realizes that he's got to decide to accept her as is or lose her. I found Tess harder to like, though I did respect her commitment to her values. Still, her uncompromising attitude and selfish judgments of those who don't share her militant views were off-putting through most of the book.Strange Bedpersons started abruptly, too abruptly, with Nick banging on Tess' door and Tess closing it in his face, the two of them obviously already sharing a history. It took a little while to get the story on their history, so the opening of the book seemed jarring and left me feeling like I missed something. It made it hard to get into and I had to struggle a bit to 'catch up.' That did subside a bit as the story progressed, though the other issues - the dated feeling and my issues with Tess - didn't. Still, I can't argue Crusie's ability to nail witty, fast-moving dialogue and touch on human truisms with humor and intelligence. I just wish that prior to republication, this story had gone through a bit of a brush up to make it more socially and culturally timely and not quite so anachronistic to contemporary romance.What the Lady Wants- 4 StarsMitchell Peatwick Kincaid is a stockbroker, but a fondness for Sam Spade and a mild feeling of discontent with his job convinced him to get a private investigator license, and about a year ago, a bet with his boss and some friends - and a lot of alcohol - goaded him into leaving his prosperous career with his prestigious firm, putting the stuff from his monied life into storage, and taking on private detecting as a career under the name Mitchell Peatwick. And if he can get his private investigation firm into the black in a year, he'll win that $10,000 bet.Twelve months of private investigating, however, taught Mitch two things: everybody lies, and real life private investigation work doesn't resemble anything remotely similar to Sam Spade's life. Until SHE walked in.SHE is Mae Belle Sullivan and she's looking for a PI who isn't all that bright so she can lie to him. Not for kicks, but to get help finding answers following the death of her uncle. Answers that will save Mae from financial ruin and explain what her reprehensible old fart of a relative was doing with all the art and keepsakes that have been disappearing from his house for the past few months. An overheard conversation pointed her in the direction of her uncle's journal, but it's been missing since he died and Mae's starting to get frantic to find it. So she lies. And she uses her feminine wiles. And she pays Mitch Peatwick just about everything in her bank account to investigate the murder of her uncle. Who was in his seventies, had a heart condition and a twenty-five year old mistress, and died in her bed. Mae's fairly certain it wasn't murder.Mitch knows he's being lied to by the delicious-looking Mae Belle, but her retainer pushes him into the black and secures his bet...and anything is better than trailing cheating spouses, so he takes her case. There are just a couple of problems for them both. Mitch isn't anywhere near as slow as Mae had hoped, and as more and more clues start to pile up, her uncle's death starts to look more and more like an actual murder - even to Mae.With a quirky cast of primary and secondary characters and a twisting, rollicking plot that includes suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy, What the Lady Wants delivers a lot of charm and a few good hours of light entertainment. Originally published in 1995, the story is a little worn around the edges and has a bit of a dated patina to it, but not so much that it detracts from the story as in some of Crusie's books. It's more like a faint scent on the air than a bat upside the head. Noticeable, but not painful.Mitch is a fun character, and quicker than he looks. Which is probably a good thing. I'm dating myself here, but he reminded me a lot of Magnum PI or Rick Simon from Simon & Simon - a bit cynical about life, a bit sloppy on the outside but sharp and thorough when he needed to be. Mae was endearing. Intelligent and kind, with a streak of independence a mile wide and a determination that is formidable. She's a bit stubborn when she needs to be, but not so cold as to be unappealing as a person. She cares about the people she loves and takes on the responsibility of caring for them, as needed. Together they made a good couple, and their banter was one of the high points of the book.Crusie excels at quickly paced plots with quirky characters and a lot of witty, intelligent, and sarcastic banter. It's what keeps me coming back to her when I want or need some brain candy. I'd love to see this story get a bit of a modernized polish to clear away the dated patina, but even as it stands, I liked it quite a bit.Charlie All Night- 3.5 StarsWhen you're the go-to girl at the radio station and you're producing the number one drive time show in the area, you've got a lot of responsibility and your future is looking bright. When the talent of that show dumps you, then two months later fires you from the show, you're bright future starts to look more like flames from a crash and burn. Allie McGuffey is feeling the heat from those flames after her radio personality ex-boyfriend Mark dumps her as producer and the station puts her on a new overnight time slot. Pushed from drive time to overnight is humiliating. Pushed there by her ex-boyfriend with his supercilious attitude and delusions of competency is even worse.Putting on a good face just leads to another crisis as a mad dash to the nearest bar/restaurant with her ex hot on her heels forces Allie into uncharted waters. She picks up the first non-suit wearing male she can find and desperately tries to act like she's perfectly okay while her insides are still quaking. Though the rugged man she clings to is obviously surprised by her blatant come on, he doesn't sell her out, which makes him a hero in Allie's book.Charlie Tenniel is a bit of a bounce around. He doesn't stay in one place too long, doesn't limit himself to doing one thing for his life, either. His wanderlust is a constant disappointment for his socially formidable father. His brother, radio personality Ten Tenniel, was more the man his father wanted him to be, but look where that got him - a drug habit and escape from prosecution courtesy of their father's connections. Charlie wasn't going to go out like that. He was, however, going to take the job his father wanted him to take as a favor to the station owner, an old family friend. An anonymous tip claims knowledge of a drug ring opperating from the station and Charlie's been conscripted to chase down the responsible party. He just wants to fly under the radar for the six weeks or so he plans to stay in town, so having Allie pressed up against him is just fine, but when he realizes she's his new producer and intends to make him a star, he's just as adamant that she doesn't.His position would probably be a lot stronger if he could just stay out of her bed.While the premise of Charlie All Night is a bit of a stretch and the actions of Allie and Charlie seem more than a little irresponsible both sexually and professionally, I can't argue that the story itself is light, fun entertainment with plenty of endearing moments. I enjoyed the banter and romantic development between Allie and Charlie. Crusie does banter and endearing really well and it's definitely in evidence here. There's not much to the plot, though, and with an original publication date of 1996, there's a dated feel to both the technology and equipment described in the station and a definite pre-Monica Lewinsky air of sexual permissiveness in the work place that didn't translate well for me.So long as you don't take the book too seriously, or expect much in the way of depth of plot or character, there's still a lot of entertainment to be had from the story of Charlie and Allie, two people who won't be poster children for sexual harassment litigation any time soon, but who still managed to make me chuckle.Originally reviewed by title for One Good Book Deserves Another."
1430,5,"It was Great change from the normal, when i saw the title thought hmm, another vampire book, but it far from that, it enchanting and captivating, to point i read it all as fast as possible, and couldn't wait to see how it went, then when i finished, i went got the next set in the series,! Bravo for being different then the normal vampire genre!!"
1431,5,"Just finished reading this for the second time, and realized I had forgotten to review it. I love this world Mr. Tuttle has created. The characters are colorful and at times bizarre. The city is dark but beautiful. My only complaint is I would like to see a bit deeper into Markhat, what drives him, what's in his past? And Mama Hog, what's her story? As for the Cadaver Client, it is a fun mystery with a spooky twist. I won't detail the plot, but rather say that this is a series that is well worth picking up, especially if you're looking for something a bit different."
1432,5,this case fits perfectly on the dx.  its great protection for your big investment. you can take it anywhere!!
1433,4,"This latest from TA Chase is very sexy and hot. Vol 1 centers on Kasey a famed but closeted basketball star, who finds love with a much older nightclub owner.The story could have been more angsy if the writer so choose asit is never easy for a gay athlete to come out as he could lose all his fans and sponsors. But TA focuses more on the erotica side, the tauntings from fellow players, reporters more a side issue. And it works as this man writes the sex scenes so well. And it is rare to have a well over 6 feet basket ball player being 100% bottom even if an agressive bottom in a relationship. Interesting main and side characters and I look forward to more in this series."
1434,5,I loved this novella because it gives an even more nuanced view of Bella and Zsadist - which I absolutely adore. A must read!
1435,5,"Ten years before Lucas was a young high school teacher just out of college; he was the classical teacher who liked to be more a friends than a authoritative figure for his students, but he did that without second thoughts. Problem was that one of his student was an unstable teen who probably would need a psychiatric help and instead his family didn't take with the right seriousness the problem. Riley, the student, approached Lucas and when the man refused him, all went to hell: Lucas was raped and left for dead in a burning cabin. He managed to survive and to denounce Riley, but he also lost his life and his lover, who couldn't suffer his scarred body.Now Lucas has a new life in a little small town where everyone loves him, above all the local sheriff; Nicholas is an handsome man, with plenty of choice if he wants, but he sets his eyes on Lucas. When they met five years before, Lucas was still too traumatized by his past events and he was not ready for something serious, and so Nicholas accepted the second choice to be his best friend. But now Riley is out of prison and both Lucas than Nicholas know that the man will come for Lucas, and Nicholas is not willing to let the man take the most important thing he has, Lucas; since Nicholas has no doubt that Lucas is his own.The story is not very long and there is not mystery, since it's clear since the beginning that Riley will try to harm Lucas once again. It's more interesting to read and see how Nicholas will convince Lucas to accept not only his help but also his love. Truth be told, I think that Nicholas takes advantage of the situation to force Lucas to accept something than in other condition it will be years before they arrive to the same point. Probably Nicholas is tired to wait (but not enough to renounce) and above all he is tired to be judge by someone else actions. And this is maybe the point that I understood less: it's true that Lucas is scarred, but only on his back; in his everyday life, with dress on, he is a very beautiful man, and no one can notice his scars. All right, being a gay man, maybe having is back all scarred is a bit more important than a straight man (naughty Elisa, I know), but is it enough of a reason to dump someone? Lucas is clever, handsome, with a good work, is it possible that someone dumped him for some scars? And even if it happened, is it possible that he chose 10 years of chastity upon the action of only one man?Anyway, the story is quite tender and the sex is good, something I noticed in the previous books by the same author: she mixes well the two elements, never letting the sex take the main role in the story, always letting the tenderness and love being in first line."

1437,4,For the first book in a series Full Moon Mating was fairly enjoyable. I am a big fan of wolf shifters and the abilities that Nate has are unique enough to keep it interesting.I'll need to read more in the series to see if it continues being good.
1438,5,I enjoyed the subtle way she wrote out the characters and pushed them into the story. Very well written. I look forward to seeing more of this writer. A MUST read.
1439,4,"What happens when two psychotic minds come together?  A story that will make the reader gasp and race through pages at lightening speed.  I have not read anything else by these authors, though I do have more of Jack Kilborn's works in my TBR pile, including Afraid.  I knew going into Serial that this was not a story for the weak stomached nor the easily offended.  Yes, it is gory, graphic and incredibly visual, however that is what makes it an appealing read.  There is no sweet coating and the story begins with an explosive bang.  With that in mind, if you don't enjoy gore, skip this one.I, truthfully, am not a huge fan of overt amounts of gore, however I was enthralled with the format and progression of Serial.  The ending was awesome and completely rocked.  The talent of Jack Kilborn and Blake Crouch combine to make an intense and entertaining short story/novella and one that I highly recommend to those fans of horror.  I greatly look forward to reading further works by both of these authors!"
1440,4,"This second book in the series was just as good as the first, with great characters and interesting story.This book cleverly overlaps in time with the first book, Secret Desires, showing the same scenes but with a different perspective. This is the story of Gregory and Ryland who have known they are destined to be mates and have known since they first met years ago. Gregory has been waiting for Ryland to 'grow up' and now that he is over eighteen, Ryland can't understand why Gregory won't claim him.When they finally get together after some initial misunderstandings, it is hot and sizzling. The relationship starts with a bang and from that time forward the two men are all over each. Ryland is totally inexperienced and has been pining over Gregory and Gregory hasn't had sex for 6 years so they are very passionate!Once again not fully understanding the implications of the tri-omega causes problems and suddenly Ryland's life is at risk. Luckily the third mate for the relationship is discovered. Viktor immediately recognises Ryland as he mate but Gregory's prior claiming causes a few concerns but nothing Viktor and Gregory's attraction to each other can't resolve. And luckily Leyland, Lucas and Jake are able to share some more insight into the whole tri-omega workings. ""You know, it would have been really nice if someone had explained all of this to us in the very beginning. Maybe you should think about publishing a f***ing how-to manual,"" Gregory yelled before slamming the phone down.Once again, this is a fun book with great characters and lots of humour. There are some minor editing problems including the odd changing of a minor characters name, noticed but easily overlooked."
1441,5,"I liked this book.  I had read the others in the series and decided to get the &#34;prequel&#34; .  No it didn't answer all my questions, but it was a good book with some memorable characters.  If you read the other books in the series, read this one.  I don't think it matters if you read this book before the others or after it. or even by it's self."
1442,5,"This buy was great.  Got five stories for what would have been the price for one.  And I love this author.  If you are interested in this genre of books, which has a  great spin on Atlantis with vampires, immortals and other creatures, get it.  You will not be disappointed."
1443,2,Too hard to get into the story...  Too many run-on sentences / thoughts...  I got bored with the character intros in the very 1st story and just deleted it off my Kindle.
1444,5,"In the final installment to the Affair Series I was riveted by the story of love, betrayal, and forgiveness between the characters. Crandall Thorne was his usual hard mouthed and manipulative self, but you also got to see the vulnerable side of him. The side that longed for the one woman he could never fully have. Dane Roarke was awesome!! I loved him. He knew what he wanted the moment he set eyes on Solange Washington, and he went for it. And even though Solange had doubts about him and him so called womanizing ways, she couldn't help but get sucked into the vortex of passion that was him. Their story was a true love story from start to finish. They showed that if you love someone you can forgive almost anything and make it work. Great story. Fantastic series!!!"
1445,5,KONRATH'S BOOKS GRAB YOU BY THE BALLS AND SQUEEZES UNTIL YOU CRY ......PLEASE  GIVE ME MORE....YES I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK.
1446,4,Great sex and a decent plot although not too shocking as to who dun it. A little body painting might have been fun.
1447,5,"It's seriously twisted, and very intense, but I loved this short story! It's not for the faint of heart, but if you enjoy some good dark & twisty stuff, then this is a great little short! The authors even add some great humor to their disturbed characters. I want to read Serial Killers Uncut after reading this little sample!This was picked up as a freebie from their website."

I had set a little time each week aside to search for free books, but now I can spend that time reading my books. This guy does all the research for me. Every day, the blog arrives with a listing of several free books. You do need to download the books before the free offer expires, but once you buy them, they are yours even when the price increases again. The blog author, Michael Gallagher finds free books in every genre and even puts links in the articles so you can get them from your Kindle.There are even occasional Kindle tips to make your device even more useful. This is one blog that is well worth the money."
1450,4,"Really enjoy reading Elizabeth Lennox and The Greeks Baby Bargain is no exception. Well done, easy reading. You will enjoy."
1451,3,This is an enjoyable erotic dragon world which I will be happy to revisit.  The characters are all very likable but the dragons who mind link and share pleasure with their knights are especially so.  The writing lags in places and the heroine is a bit vapid as is the hero. There just isn't a lot of depth here but the sexy times are well done and with fun twists.
1452,3,"the plot was okay, but I wish the story was longer.maybe describe how they have children and the house  they live in.I just felt like something was missing:(however I'll give the author credit because the story would have been a good one if only a little longer:)"
1453,5,"Kelly Kendall is a man with issues, a fact that he knows very well and has coped with by having Will as an all-around house boy.  Kelly enjoys his life as a recluse and having Will around makes life better than Kelly expected.  However, Kelly has secrets from the world, and although Will shares them, Kelly is determined to keep them safely hidden.  As the author of the acclaimed Doorways, Kelly has managed to keep his identity hidden from the world, but when he writes a parody of Doorways called Windows on a dare from Will, it attracts all sorts of attention - attention that Kelly doesn't want.Jae-sun Fields is incensed that someone would dare write a parody of the beloved coming-of-age novel Doorways.  Working for the gossip rag The Adversary, Jae sets out to find and expose the awful woman, who is surely the culprit, of such desecration of his favorite novel.  However, as his investigation progresses he finds Kelly MacKay, who seems more than tangentially connected to his quest.  But what will Jae do with the information he finds?As Jae and Kelly continually meet, more than information is found.  Kelly is immensely attracted to Jae, but fears what such a connection might mean to his self-circumscribed isolation.  Jae wants to pursue Kelly for information, but also to satisfy his curiosity about the attraction between them.  Can both of these men make it work?ePistols at Dawn is a great emotional read that delves into the mysteries of the human mind and what it means to be gay in a not so accepting society.  Jae is a wonderfully funny character with his determination to find his nemesis and his ire at the desecration of his favorite book.  Kelly is so full of quirks that it is almost too much to deal with, but Z.A. Maxfield makes him a likeable character when she uses Will as a source of reality and mocking that slowly pushes Kelly to emerge from his shell.  As the story progresses it is sometimes hard to like Jae for his actions, but his ethics win in the end, making him a better man.  Kelly, on the other hand, is crippled by his OCD and fear of being found out as the author of such a revered work that he believes to be the product of such a self flagellation exercise.  Even as the relationship between Kelly and Jae is plagued by pot-holes in the road of love, their coming together in the end finds them both being better men for all their suffering.  As expected Z.A. Maxfield presents characters and situations that will pull you into the story and reading the book all in one sitting.  Get yourself ePistols at Dawn the next time you are looking for a sexy, emotional story!SabellaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"

1455,5,"I really enjoyed reading this book.  This book is a mix of Sci Fi and the Wild West set in the future, has lots of Action, Romance with a great plot and lots of twists and turns to keep you reading!The Reaper&#8217;s Revenge was a continuation on from the first book and it started with Cynyr and Aingeal traveling back home to Haies City. Although it is a continuation of first book that was about Cynyr and Aingeal and a the people from Haines CIty, this book introduced a lot of new characters and there were it seemed two or three stories on one.  There was a lot more violence in this book but it was action packed and fast paced and kept you reading and wanting to know what would happen next.It was not lacking in the romance department either, the love scenes were definately hot and well written.  There is a touch of humor in her writing which makes the love scenes even more enjoyable to read.  Aingeal and Cynyr make for a very interesting couple in and out of bed with their charm and wit.I am absolutely in love with the Reapers, they are all Yummy Alpha Male!  The people in Haines City are also endearing in their own way.  I wish that we would have been given a bit more of a glimpse into Arawn and Danielle&#8217;s relationship though.  I loved getting to know the other Reapers in this book as well and I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens next.I would definitely recommend this book and I am looking forward to reading the next.*free copy gifted for honest review**originally reviewed for welovekink(dot)com"
1456,4,"Steamy menage erotic story.  But it also has a good love story.  I liked this book enough to buy all the others in this series.  If you're not into unconventional explicit sex stories, don't buy this... but if you have an open mind and love steamy graphic sex.. BUY THIS BOOK!"
1457,2,it has a good story line but the author was dragging on to much so i lost interest in the book when not even half way through.
1458,3,"""The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful existence.""Professor Pierre Arronax and his assistant, Conseil, join the crew of the Abraham Lincoln to chase down this strange ocean mammal that has been destroying ships. The duo, along with harpooner Ned Land, end up overboard and rescued by what is revealed to be a submarine, not a mammal. This submarine is captained by Nemo, a mysterious man who has eschewed the land in preference to roaming the open seas. Nemo takes the trio twenty thousand leagues across the seas - from the Pacific to the Indian to the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Along the way, Arronax uncovers bits and pieces about his captain and catalogs the various fish he sees.Jules Verne is basically the Father of Science Fiction. His novels - such as ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"" - were groundbreaking for their time. I'd go so far to say that if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have the science fiction genre at all.That said, this book was supremely dry and dull most of the time. Yes, it is ""hard science fiction"" with lots of attention to detail to the mechanics of underwater ""sailing"" (some of which is incredibly on the mark; others, such as the lamp lighting the way of the Nautilus, laughable and out-dated), but there comes a point when enough is enough. This is particularly prevalent when Arronax/Verne spends multiple pages describing the flora and fauna of the sea in intricate detail (""cataloging fish"" into their species and genus) or having long conversations with other characters about irrelevant history (such as the electric cable stretching from the Americas to Ireland).Again, I greatly appreciate the attention to detail and the thought Verne put into the operation of the Nautilus. That isn't my problem. And I don't mind some detail about the sights Arronax sees while traveling. But the latter in particular ""sinks"" the story. And when the story is as diluted and sparse as it is here, that is nearly a death warrant.The majority of this novel reads as a travelogue, Google Maps directions, an account of someone's rather dull vacation. While there are a few scenes that are particularly interesting (the journey to the Antarctic and nearly being trapped underwater, a way too short squid attack, and some walking underwater scenes), by far most of the book is cataloging fish or boring ""and on Mar 21st, we sailed from X in Y direction to Z"". Yawn. What makes this is even more ridiculous is that Arronax, Ned Land, and Conseil are supposedly held prisoner aboard the Nautilus, so they do not leave and divulge its secrets elsewhere, but no one seems to care about being held against their will until suddenly they are. I'd say ""Stockholm Syndrome"", only they give a half-hearted struggle when Captain Nemo tells them they are stuck on the ship. Based on how it is written and how little concern these characters have to their captivity, I don't know why Verne didn't just have Captain Nemo invite Arronax to journey with him and maybe decide that he didn't WANT them to leave.The only (and by far the best) character in this book is Captain Nemo. Sure, there is Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land, but calling them ""characters"" is a stretch, unless you are using the most generous of definitions of ""character"". Arronax is probably the best of the trio. He has some moments of humor (as a side note, there is quite a bit of humor, and it is well applied and a good break from the blandness of most of the text) and has a complicated relationship with Nemo. Ned Land would be next. His sole character trait is wanting to kill anything that moves - whales, kangaroo, tigers, you name it. Pretty much any time he appears in the story, it's to talk about wanting to kill something or escape (and honestly, he doesn't even CONSIDER escape until the last 75% of the novel). The absolute worst character, in my opinion, is Conseil. The guy makes Saltine Crackers look like they aren't bland. If you want a cold, blindly loyal servant, this is your man.But I hesitate to blame this lack of characterization on Verne's skill as an author or the standard ""But it's hard scifi, not a character study!"", particularly when you have the complex character of Captain Nemo. What the other characters aren't, Captain Nemo is. Apparently, something bad happened to his wife and his children - something bad enough to make him abandon the land all together and sail in his boat, enacting revenge on passing ships. But he isn't a cold blooded killer - he stays Ned Land's hand, when Ned wants to harpoon a bunch of whales for the hell of it. (Of course, not more than a couple of paragraphs later, Nemo then slaughters a bunch of ""sperm whales"", so calling the guy a hypocrite is definitely in order.)So the story is meh, the characters are meh, and the descriptions are overboard. Part of that is just me not really being that hot on the book (my dad, a retired Navy submariner, and my sister both ADORE this book and think I am mad for not). That's only a small part of ""Twenty Thousand Leagues"". The more important part - and the reason I think that any fan of scifi should read this book - is its influence on the genre. This is the great-great-great-great grandfather of novels like ""Ender's Game"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". So in that regard, this book is priceless - it gives me a better respect for the genre I love.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"
1459,4,I've read books with threesomes before and have never been all that impressed. This one on the other hand..homina..homina..homina!!! Loved it
1460,5,"What a yummy fun read!! It kicks things of fairly quickly, wicked little roadside steam!!! This is a very smexy read, loads of steam and variety packed into this short read. I love a hot twin menage!! Oh girl, forget the panties cause you will just have to change them later!Even though the feeling develop quickly I am willing to let it slide, sometimes lust feels like love. And hey this is fantasy, ain't nobody got time to build a relationship!! Still, I felt the liking and the connection between the three.The story is very well written and fast paced. The side mystery is interesting without being overly complicated. For such a quick story I was really drawn in, I even had a sniffle/tearing up moment at the end.I listened to the audiobook and it was a real treat!! Hello smexy voice, Gregory Salinas can read to me anytime!! Seriously call me up and read the phonebook!! He has a delicious growl to his voice that makes a girl swoon. Warning - Do not listen to this at work, you will not be able to concentrate on simple tasks and stout balding co-workers will suddenly look appealing. All the result of one smexy voice and some wickedly hot detailed steam!! He reads with such energy and enthusiasm, that a girl has to pause or embarrass herself in public!!I can only hope Ms Rylon puts more of her books on audio using this delicious narrator who gives multiple eargasms!!"
1461,5,"This book is just fun.  Written in a lighthearted way, that will make you smile.  There are a few serious issues  talked about, but they  give the reader an insight about the characters reactions. This a short book and a quick read but it contains a satisfactory love story. Enjoy."
1462,5,"A few days ago I ranted about writing love scenes in a bland, cliche fashion--throbbing members, cream, tight sheaths, etc. Well in Bite of Silence you won't be getting that. Indeed  Hughes writes scintillating, love making scenes, with a light touch.  There is no typical nookie here! If there is any issue with the book it is the titanic dimensions of the immortal Spartan in Twyla's dreams. his hand spanned her entire back.  And, the size of certain parts of his anatomy defy all logic (In Young Frankenstein, Inga, played by Teri Garr,  calls it a Scwann Schtucker).There is quite a bit of character development, and both Twyla and Nikos have been dealt a surprising depth and in Nikos' case an unexpected degree of sensitivity. The plot is improbable, maybe a bit silly. But for a light, lively read I recommend this. I know I had been debating over the past year  whether to get Biting Nixie, from the same author.  Bite of Silence helped me decide to download that book!"
1463,3,"There's nothing earth-shaking here. This is just a cute, little story about an interior designer & a construction company owner who start to fall in love (but of course fall into bed first...well, not a bed, per se...). The plot is decent, as is the writing. This is the book you read when you're bored & have an idle afternoon.I did enjoy all the design elements the author included, so there was actually some focus on something other than the hero & heroine drooling over each other. The information Kinson used was interesting & dropped into the story easily. I didn't find the characters either annoying or compelling. They were there, kinda cute, & helped the story move. I really couldn't care less about them, but I'm glad the book ended the way it did. (Guess.)As a freebie or cheapie book, this story is just fine, although there are many others that would do just as well. If you're already here, then try a sample."
1464,5,"This was an amazing book. Really enjoyed reading about Jack and Megan. Their story was Lovingly Amazing, and wish that I could read more of them. Cant wait for book 2."
1465,5,"I started out reading this expecting your typical ""love story"".  Well, once I had read a few pages, I literally could not stop until I was done.It's an odd take of the Beauty and the Beast kind of story but with a twist that makes it incredible and hard to put down.It definitely is a feel good story that ends with a happy ending but also leaving the reader with a lesson.  I found that is what made it so awesome to me.  Most romance stories just have the happily ever after thing and that's it.  However this book left me with a lesson about life.  It really is a very well written short story and one I would definitely recommend to anyone.  You don't have to just be a ""romance"" genre reader to enjoy this story."
1466,1,"what a epic let-down. this book could have been so much better. but there was no plot and tons of pointless oral sex and it wasn't even sexy sex, more like gross and crude. the main male lead didn't even think the main female lead was good enough to have normal intercorse with so he did her in the ass. gross much."
1467,5,"This is my second Kinsey Holley book, to hit my top shelf.  Top shelf means: I have read this book more than twice and *know* I will read it again.I was very hesitant to read about about a previous brother sister relationship.  Not my style, but the more I read this book the more I realized these two have virtually no ties.. other than a an adopted relationship. They never even grew up together. I loved this story (almost as much as her other books). It sucked me right in and I loved every inch of their relationship.. Lark is a wonderful character, strong with vulernabilities but the same can be said for Taran. Wonderful couple, loved the book."
1468,4,I like that I can look up my verses in church easy.  I like that I can take it with me anywhere because it is on the kindle and all I have to do is hit table of context.
1469,5,"I downloaded this book right after I read Zsadist's story in the series.Needless to say, I loved this book.  While I didn't like the beginning because of the turmoil that was going on with Zsadist and his unacceptance of his daughter.I sped through the book because I needed to know that he overcame his obstacles and as usual the book did not disappoint.I was happy for Zsadist when he finally worked through his issues and was delighted to see the family dynamic between him, his wife and his daughter.Great read.  I would love to read about Rhage and Mary as the author hinted in this book that Mary wanted to have a child.  Also, and update on the King and Queen would be nice."
1470,3,"There was no scorching sex like one critic stated--this story read more like a Harlequin Romance--light weight and too much fussing.  The story started off fine, but then the female Carly started to work a nerve--I really thought she put, Marco through the wringer and if it wasn't for the rabbit dying he should have walked away.  The female was mean to him, but let her family walk all over her.  Story was long and constant bickering had me thinking about the baby well being.  I wondered what happen to her family because they were seem to disappear once she got married.  When the author brought in her deadbeat dad it felt like she was trying to tie up loose ends.  He should have stayed gone and Marco should have read her family the riot act.  I just never felt the sexually chemistry between these two and couldn't get over the female description not matching her picture at all."
1471,5,"I don't normally read Christmas books because they don't appeal and to me it seems like a band that suddenly releases a Christmas album and you know it's just for the money.  Not that I am saying that is what was being done here, not at all, but that is my reasoning for avoiding most Christmas stories.Having said that, I loved this book!  I was immediately, completely drawn into James' world.  The story is so well balanced the humor mixed with the sadness and stress of the season, just when it is needed.  Both James and Sedgwick's loneliness, born of different experiences, made the story all the more touching.A delightful sweet read that will leave you smiling and, perhaps, as it did for me, wanting to explore more of Dickens' Christmas stories (unfortunately not The Christmas Cake)."
1472,4,I liked this authors style.  Book was well plotted and moved at a good pace.  Given the main character of the book is older this book will probably resonate best with those of us considered seniors.Good read.
1473,5,"Another great book by Heather Killough-Walden.  She draws you in instantly and keeps you interested.  You will find many surprises and wonders in this book.  After you finish it, look for the sequal; drake of Tanith."

Great reading, has a little violence. Jo-Ann Doyle"
1475,2,"I downloaded the book because I couldn't believe it was that bad.  It really didn't have much story line which is fine if the sex scenes are hot, but the erotic scenes did nothing for me.  I didn't hate the book, but it's not something I would ever read again."
1476,4,"What a fun story. It has everything I like about paranormal suspense type stories, with the added bonus of m/m.I loved Vic right from the start and cannot wait to learn more about him and his abilities. Aside from the psy aspect, he seems like such a normal guy with his insecurities and witty humor. I love Vic with Jacob, who sounds like total hotness. The sex is somewhat understated, which I think only makes it steamier in the end.I also loved both female characters. Carolyn is the perfect psy partner for Jacob, and Lisa is interesting as well. I'm looking forward to watching Lisa learn to use her ability and hope to see these two in future books.I absolutely loved the ending. What a way to wrap things up and leave me running to get the next installment. My only real complaint is that it is way to short and was over too fast."

This menage hit the spot! The characters fit each other in and out of the bedroom; they needed her and she needs the different sides of them. I enjoyed how the author portrayed Callie and her family history, from her foster family forgetting her birthday to the way she wanted to belong to the Abbotts, it was well done.Wicked Sexy is a great start to a hot steamy menage. If your in the mood for a menage with a little magic this one is for you!"
1479,5,"Beautifully written, Bound and Determined is a book that does not disappoint. I've got books by both authors and their styles compliment each other hugely and make for very cool reading.Sterling is such a brat and I loved his spark and innate cheekiness. It is such a perfect foil for Owen's more reserved nature and theirs is a relationship that doesn't always go smoothly as a result. The conflict was well written with the focus centered on the characters internal struggles. It was easy to read and didn't devolve into any silly BDSM tropes and Nancy Drew and the gang did not make an appearance I was pleased to note. heh.The relationship between Sterling and Owen is what carries this book. The slow development of trust between both men and the exploration of their boundaries, desires, and the chemistry that has drawn them together, was what made this a cut above other BDSM novels I've read recently. Nothing was rushed and the authors seemed to allow Sterling and Owen to stick to their own timetable. The slow building of sexual tension as a result was off the charts and appealed to me immensely. The sex is incredibly good and they nailed that sense of trust implicit within a D/s relationship. Rawr. It was totally hot and made for magic reading.A lush, intense and engaging read I got totally wrapped up in. If you've not read, then I highly recommend you get your backside over to Loose Id and buy it. One of my favourite reads of 2009."

1483,5,"This is a freebie this week, and I love this short! It's got everything a good erotica should. It's light, the plot is easy to absorb and believable and, dang, if the heroes aren't super sexy. Callie is a foster child who lived next door to her best friend, Harrison. Harrison's family is a part of a secret world, one of Magian and magics and, of course, really hot threesomes. When a killer is targeting Magians, Callie goes ""undercover"" to help stop the evil before it spreads.This is book one in a three-book series and while book two is a short as well (already downloaded it), book three is a bit longer. I'm hoping the author will continue writing about the Magians. If you're looking for a light quick read to make you blush, I'd pick up Wicked Sexy, book one in the Wicked 3 series.For more recs check out the HEA Blog"
1484,4,"I actually read the 2nd book in this series several years ago.  This book was a little harder to read at first due to the sentence structure. The story was very good but I took one star off due to some missed words, misspelled words, a couple of words used that when looked up didn't even match any description in The American or UK Dictionary. (Totally out of context)  That being said once I got past that this is a good book, interesting, sexy, erotic book.  I Know that I will save this book and reread it again. I would love to see another book from this series and I would definitely buy it. For 7.99I would appreciate Ms. Dane giving this book to an editor!"
1485,3,"I was ready to appreciate this book (at last a heroine who is not some ""proud beauty"" who captive the hero's lust at first sight) but I it did not live up to my expectations. I found the interaction between characters unbalanced: their sparring sounds more bickering and it was not clear to me when they started to see the other in a different light; I didn't feel that the transition from disdain, to understanding and acceptance and then to love was handled smoothly. In addition the last obstacle before the happy ending left me with the strong desire to bash the head's hero with an heavy instrument: the entire situation was absurd and could have been resolved in an heart-bit with a particle of common sense. Most likely I was expecting too much because overall the book is good, writing excellent and other characters engaging; let's say it could have been better."
1486,4,"A love affair between a Greek and a Titan.  What fun!  Must say I had never gotten in to the whole prison fantasy thing before, but this story could change my mind. Cute and short."

1488,4,"The complete works of Jules Verne for a pittance and portable at that.  I am a very happy KIndle Fire user and I've not read Verne but I know of his work and of course the several movies.  I've started 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea the font is clear the language is a little antique but perfectly understandable - it's not the Canterbury Tales.  I frankly find the older style charming.  Very good buy.  I don't have piles of books to contend with.  I can carry all of this around with me.  It is almost too good to be true.  Also have Edgar Rice Boroughs complete works which could use a little editing but nothing too egregious also a very good read if you like old pulp fiction.  It doesn't hurt that I have a wireless network at home the downloads are really pretty transparent for me."
1489,5,"With each Markhat tale I read, I am farther drawn into the world in which he lives.  Fiction is a great escape, and Rannit ranks up at the top of places I wish I could visit, on a scale with The Wastelands, and The Shire.  An excellent read!"
1490,5,I love this book and can not wait to start reading the next in the series.  I can honestly say this author spices up my life in the bed room and my husband is encouraging me to read more.  Read all the books by this author and you won't go wrong

I will return and add more when I finish it; but so far - so good.Jeff: Do NOT listen to the petty critics on here. You have the talent, and despite minor text typos and grammatical errors - the work is good.I especially enjoy the fact that like Lewis and Tolkein, you have the ability to tell a compelling story while keeping it clean. To many talented Authors nowadays who I would otherwise enjoy reading, have a nasty habit of peeing in their own talent pool, which makes it a ""No Swimming"" zone for me. Not having finished the book, I suppose I ought not to speak too soon.I look forward to returning to this review when I complete the book!"
1494,4,I love paranormal romance and this was right up my alley. This was a great story with wonderful characters. Stephanie Draven really brings her characters to life.
1495,5,"I downloaded the short story &#34;Deliberately Unbound&#34; for free and I liked it so much that I bought this book. I'm so glad I did. I loved the premise of the story, unlike anything I've read before. The characters were well developed and I found their actions believable. I would highly recommend this book."
1496,3,I've had this book in my TBR pile for close to 2 years and am glad I decided to wait to read it. I think I appreciate it more now than I would have when I first added it as I compared it a lot to Game of Thrones in setting. Really enjoyed it!
1497,4,"What can be said about this book... Is there any one who have never read it?It is good read, nice adventure, a bit old style."
1498,5,"Great read with humor, sex and mystery.  Loved Abbey, the main character with her clairvoyant ways and Italian rules to live by.  Lots of fun."
1499,4,"Loved the family aspect of the pack. Intensely sexy, makes you want to crawl in and join the fun! A must read."
1500,5,I always like an interesting story and this was a very good story i couldn't put it down until i had finished well written five stars and more &#60;3
1501,2,"Love the whole idea of a deaf werewolf, who had no idea that she was a werewolf! Sad to say that the story didn't live up to my expectations. Robyn was a little too accepting of learning that not only are werewolves real, but that she's a werewolf too! And oh yeah, hunky stranger is destined to be her mate so it's okay to sleep together immediately. Sure she was surprised at first by the werewolf thing, then it was all no big deal. Um, really? I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure I would need a little more time to process all that new information!I had a few other problems with the story, aside from Robyn's easy acceptance. The issue of her being deaf wasn't really addressed. Apparently she's a champion lip-reader and surprise! As mates, Robyn and Keil had no problem communicating. Really? Wouldn't being deaf be more of an obstacle? It was almost a non-issue, like the color of her hair or what she did for a living. I was sort of looking forward to it being a more interesting aspect of the story. And while Robyn started out as a strong, self-sufficient woman, that part of her seemed to disappear once she found her man.Aside from being a short read (less than 100 pages), I found myself skimming the sex scenes. The author used a few words that I just don't like and don't think belong in writing. I might be a prude, but I don't like sex scenes using offensive (to me) language. And does anyone really talk like that during sex? Outside of bad movies, I don't think so! Really ruined that part of the story for me.Gave this one a 2/5 as I liked the premise and thought it was an original idea, but it was too short, problems were too easily solved, and it had some offensive (to me) language. It's book one in the Granite Lake Wolves series. Others have loved this series but, based on this book, it's not for me. At least it was free!"
1502,5,"This was a fun read and a little different for Cascadia.  Where all of the other stories focus on the mated pair and the problems with the Pellini Group, this one seems to focus more on the family and the problems are ony between the mated pair.  While the Pellini Group are still there in the background, this story focuses on the chance meeting of a mated pair at a wedding.Unfortunately for our darling Megan, her destined mate has grown up being taught to hate and hide his inner wolf by a Mother who, while obviously  mated to a wolf herself, thinks that that part of them are nothing more than beasts.  She does a good one on him mentally and due to his Fathers love of his mate, he allowed it without saying anything until the damage was done.Thus begins the story of a sucessful Doctor, who lives as a human, and wants his mate to join him.  Megan, who is Second and Enforcer for Cascadia cant live away from her pack, wont live that way no matter how much she loves her mate.Will love overcome?  Will her mate learn to accept and love his wolf, or are they destined to live worlds apart and in pain for the remainder of their lives?  It is a story that has it all, and like all of the Cascadia Wolves stories, I would recommend each and every one of them!We need more Cascadia Wolves!!"
1503,4,Another wonderful link within this captivating series which I have enjoyed. I recommend it highly. You will be hAppy with this work if you have read some of its mates.
1504,5,"Ian Stanton, second son of the Earl of Rayne, has always done what was proper.  His one and only highly improper secret is his love for Nicholas Chatham, Lord Amherst, eldest son of the Marquess of Carleigh.  Five years ago, Ian and Nicky fully fulfilled their physical desire for one another, but the experience left Ian certain that it could never be repeated.  Now Ian has returned home, an ex-military captain who was badly wounded during the Peninsular War.  Forced to escort his sister to the Twelve Night gathering at Carleigh Castle, the last person Ian wants to encounter is Nicky.Nicky doesn't care that society would deem his feelings for Ian wrong.  Still, he knows getting and keeping Ian in his life will take more strategizing than a military campaign.  He has twelve nights to convince Ian that the kind of life they could have is worth risking everything for.  And Nicky will definitely need every night.A wounded soldier and his determined soul mate can definitely heat up the holidays; they definitely do in this sexy story by K.A. Mitchell.  An Improper Holiday puts its two heroes love and willingness to nearly put their lives on the line to stay together to the test.  One of the things I particularly enjoyed about An Improper Holiday is that Ian didn't take the social and legal ramifications of his and Nicky's relationship lightly.  It takes a lot of maneuvering to make an ""unconventional"" relationship work for these men, but Ms. Mitchell handles their road to happily ever after in a very interesting way.On a lighter note, I adored both heroes.  Ian is the darker one of the pair, more serious and still suffering the aftereffects of a fighting in a war.  Nicky is the perfect complement to Ian.  He's light where Ian is dark, bringing joy to the man he loves and to me as a reader.  It's impossible not to fall head over heels for him; Nicky's just that irresistible.An Improper Holiday is the first story I've read by Ms. Mitchell and it definitely won't be the last.  I enjoyed Ian and Nicky's ""improper"" romance and think back on these two handsome heroes with a smile.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1505,5,I started reading this book thinking it was going to be a so-so read. I actually very much enjoyed it! The book drew me in and I read it in 1 afternoon.
1506,5,"I like receiving this daily blog.  I've tried several blogs, but this is the only one I've kept over a few days.  Why?  I like that he posts several free books every day (at least he hasn't missed a day since I've been receiving it).  And, he gives the Amazon description.  He includes many types of books rather than sticking to one or two types.  I will keep purchasing this blog because of the reliability of posting, the varied types of books featured, and the helpful Kindle info."
1507,5,"In this quick, fun, easy-to-read book, Sally Huss shares some of her exciting life and the story of finding her prince. You will appreciate the simple and easy to follow steps suggested. With a light touch, Sally will leave you feeling inspired to find your own prince (or princess)."
1508,4,Pretty nice little set of chargers for a good price.  I like to have an extra charger for my devices and this fits the bill nicely.
1509,4,"Hers just happen to be in a supply closet.  Well written, funny parts, erotic, and romantic.  For once, a man who wants more than just sex and has to convince the woman--I enjoyed it."
1510,4,"I often have to reset my brain during the first chapter or two of books that are new worlds, and this was the same. The story started strong though and was definitely worth the effort. I had to remind myself that in the age and place of Nicole's world, children grow up a lot faster than my four. They have a maturity necessary for the hardships they will face.Aislinn came off strong and determined from the very beginning. I loved that she knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to go after it even though it was not the accepted norm for her country. Many times she was so stubbornly focused on her goal that she missed or ignored certain aspects of a child's life. This was one of the things that made her so real to me. I could relate to that stubborn focus.I also loved how she matured over the years. One of my favorite scenes is when she breaks down in tears over the death of a young girl. It is a great moment when you realize what a caring woman she has grown into on top of her strength as a knight in training. The balance and realism is expertly crafted. A true example of how to show who your character is and not telling.There is also a sweet romance woven through this book. I didn't feel like it was the main focus, but the back and forth between these characters is so natural you can't help but be swept away by it. When it looks like there is no way they can ever be together, you ache with Aislinn.All in all, I really enjoyed this read and can't wait for life to slow down so I can read the  next two books in the series."
1511,1,I hated this book so much I deleted it! It was disgusting! I hated reading about a cat who was a laboratory experiment.  The details were too graphic and turned my stomach.  I actually had nightmares! It's a definite NO!!!!
1512,3,I love the Black Dagger Brotherhood and I should of probably read this when I was by Zadist and Bella's story but it was still good. I love Zsadist and know he is going to be a great father.
1513,5,"Hot, hot, hot! The best Jess Michaels book I've read so far. It's made of three intertwining stories, each hotter than the next! Definitely recommend for fans of well-written erotica!"
1514,4,I downloaded this book for free. I rate a free book on whether or not I would pay for a book by the author. I would buy a book by this author. May not be the best I have read but worth the time.
1515,5,"Wow love this story, I love how Sean and how he tries to compromise with Caitlyn, and the result is perfect. I would recommend this author and this book."
1516,4,"This is Science Fiction Romance so we know the destination.  It is the journey that makes this such a good story.  There is enough action, adventure and romance to satisfy any SFR fan...Povre and Kent are bot great characters."
1517,5,"Great plot and hot, hot shapeshifters! The moments of humor were good and the deep friendship between the guys was touching."
1518,1,i didnt like the sample too much but hped it would get better. i like black books because they take place where we are from but this one is so damned slowi keep skimming and skimming. its a decent plot kind of late elmore leonard like but it is so badly writtenwith terrible plodding dialogue its too much for me. i cant get through it
1519,1,Thank God this was free because it was so terrible. 1. Heroine meets hero 10 seconds later they are declaring they have feelings for each other and they have sex (she of course a virgin) 2. They then decide to go back to his Dragon lair after the heroines mother who is perfectly ok with it because what mother wouldn't be perfectly okay with it? 3. Then when they get to the lair there is this weird rule where she has to marry two men and that man falls in love the next day with her (mom is okay with this too bc mama Dragon told her it was the way things were)and they have some boring m/f/m sex..this is all intertwined with the dragons of course and that is also rather boring. All in all hated it.
1520,5,"It is a great book for all Christians. It is an easy read.I enjoyed it, and I am sure most will as well."
1521,5,"I absolutely loved this short story. The whole aspect of it in general was interesting. The sex in it was great, not too much but just enough in my opinion. I wish it was a longer book, I want more :)"
1522,5,An enjoyable read...my boyfriend is loving the effect this book is having on me!!  I'll be checking out more of R.G. Alexander's books
1523,4,This ebook was pretty good.  I was surprised at how much it reminded me of 50 Shades of Grey.  I enjoyed it and it kept my attention.  It was way too short. ;)
1524,5,"The story captures you from the beginning.  It combines laughter, love and suspense at times.  Love Ruby!!!! First book of a great series that keeps you wanting more!!!"
1525,5,"This is not what I typically read, but I am glad I saw it and downloaded it to read.  It wasn't` a quick read, the subject is too sad for anyone with sensitivity or heart to rush through.  I stopped frequently, because I couldn't see through my tears and I couldn't stop them.  Patricia Halloff has written a book as memorable and touching as ""WHERE THE RED FREN GROWS.""  Sissypuss is told from a feline's point of view, utilizing the voices of several memorable cats that were part of the main characters' too short, too tragic life.  It is a book that every animal lover should read and pass on to others in the hope that the world can become a more humane place for all of its inhabitants.I've loved animals ever since I can remember, but my mother was allergic to cats so I couldn't have one until I had my own home.  Since then I`ve always had at least one cat and usually a dog also.  My daughter loved animals as much as I did, but she was partial to cats.  I believe it was because they recognized the loving, proud, independent nature they each shared.I know that there are people that torment animals just because they can and organizations that claim they are doing it as research and I hope that in the future that those who perform these acts will be severely punished here by law and in the afterlife.  I also would like to see the people who dump pregnant or unwanted litters of animals out to die punished severely.  This beautiful book sheds light onto a subject that we would prefer to ignore, but in doing so, we are condemning more animals to a cruel, senseless fate that will eventually lead to death, but not before, they have suffered too long at the hands of their tormentors.**UPDATE: June 2013: After much contemplation, I have decided to change how I rate the books I read. I feel that this is necessary for two primary reasons; there are too many high rated reviews from ""SP's and or friends of the author. Secondly, we are limited by Amazon's rating system which I feel needs to be changed but until then this is my only option. My standards for the stars, (noted in the title of review), are shown below:**5 STARS: This will be for books that I consider outstanding, meaning that I will keep the version I have to reread again.4 STARS: Books I would have previously rated as 5 will be 4.50 or higher and books under 4.50 will be the same as Amazon's 4 (I Like It).3 STARS: Books I would have previously rated as 4 will be 3.50 or higher; books under 3.50: will be the same as Amazon's 3 (It's OK, recommend).2 STARS: Books I would have previously rated as 3 will be 2.50 or higher; books under 2.50: it was good enough to finish, not recommend.1 STAR: Books I would have previously rated as 2 will be 1.50 or higher; books under 1.50: I didn't like it, but eventually I finished it; books under 1.50: I did not like it and may not have finished reading, not recommend.0-STARS: Need I say more. NOT RECOMMENDED!"

1527,2,"I love most of Evangeline's books, but this is not one of them. This is nothing against the writing; as always Evangeline does a great job of writing a story. My problem is that I have no interest in her male/male books and think it should be clearly stated in the book description. It was not! Had the free sample to read been a page or two longer, it would have been clear when the men began kissing. Had the three previous book reviewers stated this, I would have known to avoid the book. I even went to the author's website (before buying the book) where her books are broken into themes, M/M being one of those, but this book was not listed as a M/M. If this is your thing, then by all means buy the book, but if you are opposed to M/M kissing and oral sex, avoid! The two star rating is for Amazon not stating this was a M/M book; Evangeline's writing style is worth four stars, but I want anyone thinking of buying the book to know what they are getting."
1528,4,"This is only the second fantasy book I have read in my adult years. I am surprised by how much I enjoyed it.It's medieval days and Aislinn is seven years old but desires to be a knight and take her dead brother's place in the king's ""army."" Her little seven year old self takes a coach to the kingdom and presents herself to the king. She begins training to be a knight. There is math, reading and writing, horsemanship, archery, weapons, and swimming. Aislinn overcomes every obstacle in her path from a group of bully boys to an ornery horse. She makes friends with two boys, one of them the future king. As they grow up together in this school for knights, Aislinn and Prince Caelan fall in love. But Aislinn must focus on obtaining her knighthood (she is the first woman to attempt it in this kingdom) and Caelan must marry another.There are a few battles between some group called the Speicans and a lot of good life lessons for Aislinn. There were a few fire breathing dragons doing a flyby or two and my eyebrow did go up when the half lion/half eagle creature ""mind talked"" to Aislinn. (What was that about anyway?? Nothing came of that at all...)I really enjoyed it, especially reading about a young girl learning to be a knight, but there were a lot of typos for a published book and a lot of things were left unexplained (There is a sequel tho). Also, Aislinn's dead brother showing up and talking about knights in Heaven was weird.Otherwise, great book, well written, and about a strong female character."
1529,5,"Appalachian Trail Mix is number 5 in the Rachel Myers Murder Mystery series by Annis Ward Jackson. I loved this one, but I am going to have to go back and read them in order because some things had happened in book 4 that left me a bit puzzled at the beginning of this one, but I figured them out.  I suggest reading them in order.  I've read one other and loved that one, too.Rachel is settled in with her new job as administrator of the Sheppard Springs Retirement Center in her home territory in North Carolina, and her former boyfriend, Robby, and his son have moved on to St. Louis, Missouri where Robby is now Chief Detective for their police department.  Rachel and the other members of her chamber ensemble are looking for a violinist to take the place of their former violinist who passed away.  They have just a couple of weeks to find a replacement.Amidst all of this, a man named Julian Spencer comes to town and is interested in doing some advertising for the retirement center where Rachel is employed.  He gives his presentation which is very nice. Julian Spencer is quite handsome and takes Rachel to lunch.  It's a bit hard to pin him down on when he can commit to doing some ad work for the retirement center, though.Rachel's female friends decide that in order to get her mind off Robby, it would be good for her to go on a hike on the Appalachian Trail with them in a few weeks.  It would be a 9-mile hike that would go through a corner of the county.  Knowing that it would be futile to say no, Rachel agrees, packs up and on the chosen day takes off with her friends for the hike.Rachel is an excellent gardener and since it is early April, signs of spring are showing, but for Rachel, it isn't a lovely patch of early wildflowers she finds, but instead it is a dead body lying in the forest.  They seem to appear wherever Rachel goes. She finds the body of a young woman wrapped in a red plaid blanket, and it looks like she's been dumped in the woods where no one would be likely to find her.Rachel and her friends call 9-1-1 and have the authorities come out to look at and remove the body.  Rachel and her friends are questioned, and throughout the rest of the book, people who could be suspects pop up everywhere and with motives.  Through all the background checks, questioning and denials, the ending will bring to light something you won't expect and someone with a trail of crimes as long as the Appalachian Trail.Rachel Myers is just an all-around nice person who doesn't take much foolishness, but who is kind and gives the benefit of the doubt.  She is an accomplished cello player with the chamber ensemble who can still use some help once in a while, an excellent gardener and also an accomplished horsewoman.  She loves her home in North Carolina and her father's best friend, Isaac, who lives nearby.  Rachel Myers, the creation of Annis Ward Jackson, is someoneI'd like to have as friend and neighbor.  This is the second book I've read, and I want to read the entire series.  5 stars from me!"
1530,3,"I liked how the three met, but quickly became bored after the first half of the book, and you know when you prefer this type of book and are skipping the sex screens its to repetitive...."
1531,2,"did not think this was scary in the least.  kimd of bored, was expecting somethimg realistic from the other reviews."
1532,5,I like all of his books. What a bargain to get 12 of them in a bundle for my Kindle. One of my favorite sci fie authors at a great price.
1533,4,"Ridges has some great insights into the scriptures, I love all of his works that I have read so for and this is like my sixth or seventh book by him"
1534,5,"A HARD BOOK TO PUT DOWN. LOOKING FORWARD TO READING CONTINUING STORIES, ENJOYED ALL THE CHARACTERS . I WOULD RECOMMEND TO MY SISTER"
1535,2,"Too bad it's not enough to save this story. I love almost any erotica or romance with Dragons. The dragon giving uh *gulp* oral sex was a little too yuck for me. I thought there might be dragon shape shifters, but there wasn't any.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 3 to balance out the 5 star reviews (two of whom are people I suspect get paid to review books)"
1536,5,"This book is beyond hot.  If you like your romances on the steamy side, this is the book for you!  By steamy, I mean scalding hot. However, it should be noted that in addition to the heat, this book also has an incredibly satisfying love story."
1537,5,both stories keep you wondering if they can overcome their past to forge a future together. love is hard to find and easy to mistake for lust or lust for love...these  authors keep the  story moving at a steady pace and exciting...
1538,5,This is a short novella prequel to the &#34;Leopard Series&#34;.  Brandt & Maggie's romance.  Every book in this series is excellent.
1539,5,I loved all of the characters in this book.  They were truly very likable people.  I loved the overall storyline.  The paranormal aspect was great.  I always reread the books that I really enjoy.

1541,5,"When a New Age SS materializes in Venezuela, and fighter jets from a revitalized Venezuelan Air Force start to threaten the area, the X-Battalion is fresh from a successful mission against a drug lord in Columbia.  This unit is full of mavericks and mad men, high tech helicopters and high tech weapons.  And when this top secret experimental arm of the U.S. Military, known as the TF-Nightstalkers, find themselves on another mission to stop what some would deem unstoppable, well it then gets really interesting.  I won't spoil the story by telling too much, but will ask that you read this one as you will not be disappointed.  Edge of your seat all the way."
1542,4,Disappointed it was not her life story. I have to buy another book to read the rest of her life. I don t know if I will buy another.
1543,5,"A novel full of magic and suspense. A strong woman, Miranda, sets out on what becomes a dangerous journey as she uses every resource she has in an attempt to locate her missing husband. She soon learns she cannot trust anyone, with the exception of a most unlikely companion: a stray cat that refuses to leave her side. And so begins an incredible mystery full of friends and foes and an increasingly difficult time determining the difference...The writing itself is solid (and well-edited). Characters are so richly described I felt as if they could walk right off the pages and into my living room for a cup of tea and a chat. The atmosphere crackles with vibrant energy; I could almost smell the salty sea air, feel the chill of a brisk evening night, and smell freshly baked bread wafting through the cobblestone streets. The author has a way with words that grabs a hold of the reader and refuses to let go. She creates a foreign yet familiar world and I was so entranced by her writing and this story that I found my mind wandering back to the curious and charming world of Miranda during the day and I could hardly wait to get home and back to the novel. I finished this novel 2 months ago and finally got around to reviewing it. In all honesty, I remember even the smallest of details after that much time and many more books read since. That is a gauge as to the intensity of this haunting novel and a testament to the author's skill.I would read this book again. And again. Whimsical, charming, suspenseful, mysterious, fun, beautiful, intriguing: I could go on with similar adjectives for hours. A very enjoyable and satisfying read with an unusual and satisfying ending. I highly recommend this novel, although I wouldn't start it before bed on a work-night. You may well find yourself reading into the very early morning hours. Enjoy!"
1544,5,"This is the best book I have ever read in my life.  I am 60 years old and read about 100 books a year.  This is a story about a group of men who really care about each other and risk their lives to help each other.  There is plenty of action and adventure to keep your interest, but the true story is this group of men.  I keep it on my Kindle, and when I have nothing else to read, I open the book and re-read it.  I wish modern novels where of this quality.  I enjoy all of his books, but this is his best.  I recommend it to everyone, and it is free, how can it get any better."
1545,2,"I kind of take the reviews with a grain of salt, it's subjective to each person's viewpoint. I liked other books by this author like Collision Course and No Souvenirs. I thought ok it's a short story, it can't be that bad. I was wrong, it ended at 1109 locations, 66 percent. The ending was so abrupt, it wasn't just having a few questions. It was almost as if the story stopped in the middle, I expected to get the next chapter when I turned the page and all of a sudden I am staring at the author's bio and I can't figure out what happened. I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong. Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck. I have read many stories by this author, some I liked and some I didn't. However, I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now. I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well, but there was hardly any relationship development. Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry. If she had developed this story like the 2 books I already mentioned it would have been great. Mitchell chose the wrong story line for this short short story. I hope she revises and republished this story in a way longer format. I want to know what happens. Trust me, I have read short stories that had the perfect plot line that it could be told in a way that the reader was happy at the end. This definitely isn't it. Save your money, don't make a mistake like I did."
1546,4,i like the fact the main character was bisexual and not full on gay... cause i dont care for woman turning a gay man out plot. the one thing that i didn't care for was how one minute he was dead set on not having a menage with her and another man but yet the next minute he had no problem doing it with an unknown guy. i think there was enough scenes in the book to make you believe those two as a couple
1547,4,Meggy has always wanted a Daddy and she found the perfect one in David who she had found on-line.  She plans and then goes to spend a week with her new Daddy who is yes very strict but also very loving.

1548,5,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews on books, but on this one I had to make an exception. I absolutely loved this book. It was different and very interesting. I can't really find the words to describe the way I feel about this book, but this is kinda the way I felt about this book, it wasn't the best book I have ever read, but I couldn't seem to stop reading. If I had a minute at work I would be reading, and every other minute I had free I would be reading it. I would absolutely recommend this book to everybody, I don't agree with the one star ratings, yes at times the writer should have explained better, but that is why you have an imagination. It was such a good plot that I didn't mind having to use my imagination at times."
1549,5,"Belle Taylor has her life carefully mapped out.  She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
1550,5,"I read the 1st and loved it, read this one and loved it and will start reading the next one when I get home from work today. I love the different characters, races and magics associated with each one. The world is incredible. I never once lost interest, I wanted more!"
1551,5,This is a great love story with a twist. Tick has been in love with Gracie for 13 years and after his fathers death she and her son comes to live on a house on his land. The romanic between then brings up based on the fact that she had something to do with the murder of Tick's father. As the story goes on and they spend time together truth behind his father's death starts to surface. Gracie has 3 secerts that she won't tell Tick until he sexual gets it out of her. She has never been touched or caught another man's eye like Tick has done for her. Tick believes she has been in bed with more lovers than anyone but the way she acts around him makes him start to wonder if it is just him or her. I loved how the truth of her son and the murder of Tick's father brings them both together in a way they should have been 13 years ago.
1552,4,"This is not a criticism. Knowing (and loving) Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin as I do, it made the stories even more enjoyable for me.Just like Wolfe, Wistril is rotund, loves to eat, loves to drink beer, and spends his time reading. He also, just like Wolfe, says, ""Bah,"" ""Pfui,"" ""Flummery,"" and ""Confound it."" Not to mention they both bellow.Archie, as Kern, does all the legwork and gets all the best wisecracks.  He even takes a stack of papers out of his desk, just as Archie does.We had horrendous thunderstorms today, and it was a perfect time to lose myself in the land of Kauph with Wistril and Kern and all the gargoyles. Hoot (read it to understand).I only gave this book 4 stars because of minor editing and continuity errors. I would like to have given it 4.5.I will certainly read the next one."
1553,5,"These stories lack horror, suspense, and violence. A decided plus for me. The problems are intriguing and the solutions interesting. I like Max and his 'man'. Clever inventive intelligent plots and solutions."
1554,2,all that down home chatter was way overthe top.this is not one of mr. nicholson's best.i found it boring and silly.
1555,2,"Can neither say I would recommend or not, it just didn't grab me in the first few pages, for me that is what it's about.  Get my attention  or I put the book down never to get picked up again. Probably.miss a few good books th a t way but that's who I am."
1556,5,"if you like the sexy exotic type of books, this is a must.  Read it a few months back but may just read it again."
1557,4,"The Fall of Troy was a HOT book, but what I really enjoyed was the fact that the heroine wasn't your run of the mill twenty-four year old size six minx.  Instead she was a seasoned woman with a plus-size figure.  And she maintained that size throughout the book, which I love because all too often the heroine somehow miraculously loses weight and you're wondering why the hero is still attracted to her when her curves sold the deal in the first place.Overall the sex scenes were a little eye opening but I was fine with that and this was a good read."
1558,4,"*Banging head repeatedly into the wall*I can't. I just can't. Gena's sinking her claws further into me with every God damned book!*Growls in frustration*Altas, Titan God of Strength, is a sex-ay God that is finally free of Tartarus and in control of the jail once more. He tried to escape before by seducing Nike, Greek Goddess of Strength. Her and every other female jailor -_- Typical, idiot male, he was in love with her but was single-minded on getting free so he betrayed her anyway.Nike found out before she freed him, of course, and he got thrown back in jail and her name carved across his chest. Did I mention that I am FLUVING this woman right now? *Delirious smile*Thousands of years later, Nike is now under Atlas' control and he's tattooing his own name into her back. Forced, I know, but so sexy. Really.Both are convinced that they're over each. Yeah, okay. Atlas is about to be faced with not only the fact that he still loves her and can't be with anyone but her, he's also about to find out how far he'll go to have and save her.And by have, I mean HAVE. Ungh...that man...This couple is probably Gena's hottest, yet. And in a short story, too! The passion between them had me throbbing 'till it hurt. I read through the whole thing in one sitting, too enthralled to put it down :p"
1559,4,"Okay with full disclosure, I got this book because of the cover. I am not a paranormal fan. I don't like lichen adventure. I do however like westerns and hot romance and this book DID NOT disappoint. It was all things adventure and romance. I wasn't grossed out by supernatural descriptions that go on and on to infinity."

1561,5,This book was just one more great example of Delle Jacobs Scottish tales.  I love her writing.  It takes you into the story and makes you part of it!
1562,5,"I never read this great book growing up.  Now is the time to catch up on the classics and to think, &#34;It was free!&#34;"
1563,5,"This was my second Nicholson read, the first being the short story collection Scattered Ashes.  Both have reminded me of Stephen King's grasp of true human fears and Hemingway's ability to make the mundane a riveting read.Nicholson is clearly one of America's most undervalued writers."
1564,5,Loved it could not put it down read this book in two days. I loved it Its a must read
1565,5,"I really liked this PsyCop story.  Victor Bayne is one of my all time favorite characters.  He is neurotic and courageous at the same time.  My only complaint about this series is that there are not enough stories.  I have found that anything written by Jordan Castillo-Price are worth reading.  I do wish she would do audio books,"

1567,4,"Elizabeth MacMillan leads a charmed life. She has a good husband who provides well for her and their son Christopher. They live in an upper/middle class subdivision with good neighbors and friends where nothing bad ever happens. That is, right up until the moment when Brad decides he needs some more space and moves out. Now, twelve months later, Brad has disappeared and Elizabeth finds herself in the unenviable position of not only having to provide for herself and Christopher, but also having to face all those people she once thought were good neighbors and friends.Max Marino has finally reached the place in his life where things are looking up; he has built up his own construction company and has a good contract going. Or so he thinks, right up until the moment a crazy lady comes flying past his worksite and almost runs over one of his men. Angry as all get out and not thinking too clearly, Max jumps in his truck and follows the crazy lady home. He bursts into her kitchen only to find the lady sitting at her table in tears, after giving her a good talking down he leaves her house feeling like a louse.Max and Elizabeth both think of their disastrous meeting as just something that happens, and put it out of their minds until they once again meet up at the hospital where Elizabeth is seeking employment. This time the meeting is more subdued and both realize that they just might find something about the other that they like. Feeling contrite about their first meeting, Max offers to help her fix her gutters and when a hesitant Elizabeth turns him down, he gives her his card just in case she changes her mind. Elizabeth has more on her mind then good looking men though. Christopher is not dealing well with his father's abandonment, she has to struggle to make ends meet and all their friends have now turned into petty, spiteful people. Luckily for Elizabeth, the other fallen woman of the neighborhood, Leslie Gibson, comes calling and offers friendship and a shoulder to cry on.Can life go on for this little rag tag group of misfits, or will they not be able to get over their own individual heartaches? Seasons will change and only time will tell.Ms. Forster is the master of storytelling. She writes in different genres, from legal thrillers and spine tingling mysteries, to women's romance, all of which have one thing in common, her ability to tell a good story filled with rich characters and thought provoking plots.In this story she tells us of one woman's struggle to become an independent person while continuing to be the mother she desires to be, and hopefully finding peace with a man who truly cares about her. Elizabeth is not a strong woman when we first meet her, as a matter of fact she is everything I personally don't like in a woman. She is totally bound to her husband and when he leaves her she can't cope. She doesn't know how to make a living, isn't sure how to handle her son, hasn't ever had a close friend and can't figure out how to deal with a good man. I have to say I didn't like her in the beginning, and even though she grew throughout the story, I still found her a bit of a selfish one dimensional person.Max, on the other hand, was a good man through and through. He took on Elizabeth, Christopher and his own problems all with the patience and love of a saint. I gave him more than a little bit of my heart.Christopher was a troubled child who needed a much firmer hand than Elizabeth was capable of giving him, and my heart ached for him, though at times I just wanted to give him a good spanking.Leslie was a good friend and I would have liked to have gotten to know her better, I think she and I would have been friends.While I enjoyed this book, it wasn't my favorite of Ms. Forster's works. I just couldn't warm up to Elizabeth and that kept me from giving her any sympathy and took away from the book for me.I recommend anyone who enjoys a good chick lit to draw a hot bubble bath, grab a glass of their favorite beverage and settle in, they won't be disappointed.Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild Dual Review Team"
1568,4,Three out of three. This is a good series.I enjoyed it very much and hope there are many more.Thank you.
1569,4,"So after I finished reading Burn for Me, the first book in Ilona Andrews&#8217; new and AMAZING Hidden Legacy series, I got to talking with another Ilona fan, who had been told that the world-building in Burn for Me was similar to the worlds in the Kinsmen series and the novella, Of Swine and Roses.And I was like, &#8220;Huh. I can see that.&#8221; But it&#8217;d been years since my early OMG-I-LOVE-Ilona binge, so I decided a reread was in order.And here we are.Some time in the indeterminate future, when space colonization was the new Big Thing, humans began to genetically enhance themselves. They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question. And one you will only get the answer to by . . . wait for it . . . yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;READING the book. *winsome face*Verdict: a quick, fun, and SEXY read. Yes, I know it&#8217;s Ilona Andrews, and yes, I know that fabulous as she is, she&#8217;s not particularly well known for sexy times, but there&#8217;s a first for everything, right? Highly recommended."
1570,5,"I was unsure if I would like a paranormal love story, boy was I wrong!  This story grabs you from the start and I didn't want to stop reading it!  The premise is totally believable and the way the author writes the story unfolding, keeps it believable.  Grab this book for a quick, enjoyable read.  Looking forward to other stories from this author."
1571,4,"I see the Kindle version is currently unavailable. I guess they pulled it to fix it (had occasional missing words, etc.). Oh, well. I was able to enjoy the story anyway. I'm an Alexis Harrington fan and I like most anything she writes. Desperate Hearts was no exception.I thought this book, all in all, was very well written. I liked the story, the leads, and the supporting characters, too. The danger/stakes seemed real, and nothing about the plot or the writing particularly pulled me out. In fact, the love scene in the shack really got to me for some reason. I rarely re-read a scene, but that one, I did. Like four times! LOL The only thing about DH that bugged me a little was the hero's change of heart/choice at the end. It seemed a little too easy and the ending felt a little rushed. But it didn't ruin the overall experience for me. I'm still glad I read the book.Good historical romance. 4 1/2 stars."
1572,5,"Recommended read.Heroine and Heroes were likable, plot fun and believable, and there was romance with each of the three brothers as are heroine grew to  appreciate and lover each of the three brothers and their individual and different qualities.Realistic non-sexist reason for the brother's needing a relationship with just one woman for all three brothers.  The fact that the brother's were Werebears [the brother's were so lovable I say werebear but I'm thinking carebear (he he,will Jack send me to the corner for that comment? chuckle)] was only a minimal part of story and was really just a backdrop and reason for the authority structure between the brother's and their need for privacy/secrecy.Much better read than previous review states.  Previous reviewers may have been expecting erotica - where this book was more of an enjoyable sexy fun romp [m/f only] where you fall in love with all the characters and really wish them a HEA.  The best romance novel's are the ones that make you laugh/smile.  enjoy :)"
1573,5,"Everything was great, the ONLY problem I had was that after being with Jack, Megan runs away ""to think."" Granted she thinks he's unstable, but then you don't have sex again with the person!"
1574,5,This was the prequel to the Lone Star Sisters series and if it is any reflection to how the series will be I won't be disappointed. Looking forward to reading the next one.
1575,4,"Enjoyable, low key mystery. Plenty of murders but not too much violence (in the way they are handled). 60 year old, unemployed man, is caught  up in The Case of the Murdered Cheer Leaders. Along the way he comes into the orbit of one fellow high school student, from many years ago, who was still in the mood for love. He, himself, has also been warned that his efforts to help the remaining former students, will bring on him the same fate as was meted out to his female classmates. A warm, congenial book despite the grim subject matter, l found it quite pleasant. The hero is a good companion for the time it takes to read the story, so, too, is his  security guard buddy, and, even, most of the police on the case. The author writes well, the plot, though creaky is serviceable and the more relevant characters nicely sketched. I will happily now move on to other books by Moats."
1576,4,"This is the third in a SF series entitled ""The Galactic Alliance."" It is not a stand alone book. It should be read after the first two books in this series. The first two being ""Translight"" and ""Chroniech."" I am not sure what the author intends but it feels like the conclusion of a trilogy.Do not be put off by the absolutely atrocious cover art. (This is especially true of the first two books, ""Honor Thy Enemy isn't as bad.)If I had seen the first two in the book store (and my somewhat suspect memory seems to recall I did) I would not have looked further. But as they were the right kind of price for experimentation with a Kindle, I bought them. I'm glad I did. It speaks of a believable far future with engaging lead characters. Its a fun read for anyone with a SF bent."
1577,4,"When I got my new Kindle I was searching around for free amazon.com books to test out my new toy. I wanted some fluff, something to read under a maple tree in the grass on those sunny summer days, and this book looked like it fit the bill. With low expectations I began reading (it is free after all). To my surprise I found that Kemppainen had put some thought into this story. It's fast paced and interesting, a book you don't want to put down because there's never a slow spot. He develops caricatures that I cared about and a world that was a mixture of his suggestions and my assumptions. This is one of those stories where you see the action in your head as you read and wonder afterwards whether Kemppainen told you the building looked like that or if you put it together yourself. He never gets lost in the details but focuses his attention right where it needs to be, giving us just enough rope.Not only is the story fast paced but it is multidimensional. This isn't just the story of one caricature but the interwoven stories of many residing within a world which takes on its own life and feel as we see it through different lenses. Kemppainen also manages to give us some mystery. Throughout the book I knew something was missing, it's just around the corner and I turned each page hoping to find it in the next paragraph. Like any good mystery we aren't just strung along until the last page but given crumbs that lead us to the author's pay off.This is not Isaac Asimov, with his deep and complex worlds which challenge today's social orders. It is a fun and exciting futuristic (but not space shippy) read that walks the narrow line between light reading and good old fashioned fun. There are books that you read because they are classics and expand your mind and then there are books you read because they make you feel good. This is a fun feel good book."
1578,1,It wasn't all that. It could have used some more story to it. I like to read books that I can either relate to or that has a story to it that will keep me interested. This book just didn't do it for me. It started out good but it didn't end like it should.
1579,5,"Just look at my other reviews of this series.  I truly enjoyed these books, and look forward to reading more from Jack Shane."
1580,5,"The Didache is a compilation of the teachings of Jesus Christ written by His apostles in the 1st century. It is beautifully written in simple yet powerful language about the love of God, neighbor, fidelity, and hope.  The Didache is a rebutttal to those who say that Christianity and its traditions were made up in the 4th and 5th century.  The Didache's words prove them wrong. Great reading for all!"
1581,5,"mystery, sex . Johari and Moses together after years apart, explanation of separation. Love the way these books are written no cliff hangers if you continue to read each book everything is revealed."
1582,5,"I just have to comment and state that in the print explaining the book, it does say that this is a lead in! Which means it will either be a sample or a short story. I get tired of people putting one stars for their mistakes. It makes the author look bad. Im pretty sure tons of you just read the title and went click to buy it now. Always read the print and reviews before you buy, then maybe you wont be disappointed when it wasnt what you thought. The stars are for what you thought of the actual work, it's not meant to be a rating for anything other than that. You have to remember that this is how they make a living and it isnt even the authors fault at how things are worded, probably an editor or one of the many people working for them. Granted, I agree that to fix this problem, more authors should be aware and that SAMPLE should be so bold that you could hardly miss it, but we are adults, you know."
1583,4,"It was a good book, though I got confused when all of a sudden his affections seemed to change. As we start reading, I thought that he was going to go with Darla, the panther shapeshifter. He was talking about how he had watched over her, and was starting to get a little hot and bothered since there were no owl shapeshifters in the area. And I for one love that owl's were featured instead of the typical werewolves or panthers. I think that was my favorite part of the book. I'm glad he ends up with another owl shifter, but it still sure was confusing.There were some things here and there that seemed odd, not to mention them getting straight to business, if you know what I mean, the same day they meet. A bit fast, but then you could blame it on the animal side. All in all, it was a great book, I felt that it wasn't extremely predictable, and it was not stereotypical, either."
1584,3,"This was a different type of read for me.. Specially because it left more questions than gave answers. It could have easly been a whole story of friendship turn into a love story as it definitely had everything else to make it great all on its own. Elysia and Darien were really cute and I would have like to hear more about their friendship before the collapse. I'm definitely thinking about getting the actual trilogy which apparently is set in the same world as this story.Jeri Smith-Ready's Aspect of Crow trilogy: Eyes of Crow, Voice of Crow and The Reawakened."

1588,4,"James and Lorna were drawn to each other from the very first. He was a doctor and she in medical school. When she became pregnant, they married, but she lost the baby. Lorna went into a deep depression where she shut James out. Their brief marriage ended in a divorce, but they never got over their few months of bliss. When a car pile up brings injured Lorna to James's ER, they are thrust back together, but the old wounds haven't healed, and Lorna is afraid to talk about the past.I hated the opening where May, the older nurse, was recalling all the evidence of James's sexual prowess. In fact, I was so disgusted I almost quit reading and deleted it at that point, but then it got better when Lorna, his ex-wife, came into the picture. I did like the novella, although it had steamy sex scenes I could have done without. The story and characters were interesting."
1589,5,"This book should come packaged with a thud pillow and something to bite on. If you love mm romance, and especially if you love a little bdsm, you will LOVE this story. If you're like me and you tend to avoid cowboy stories because they seem to cliche, fear not, the story is fantastic, and the love scenes are so hot. The bondage stuff isn't heavy but there is enough to enjoy sinking your teeth into. ;)"
1590,4,Short novel but well written as all of Maya Banks work. It will keep you entertained and touch your heart with romance.  Would have read more on these characters and their story.
1591,5,I found the book to be Very interesting and intriguging with an underlying story line that I found quite interesting.  Love the secondary story line of the Fallen Angels and especially of the teaching that the Lord FORGIVES ALL.
1592,2,"I have become a HUGE Lora Leigh/Breed fan, but this novella left me disappointed. I have come to expect amazingly hot love scenes from LL and her Breed series but i also love the development of the plot and characters along with it, but in Wolfe's Hope it was like LL decided to remove anything of importance and give the reader a couple dozen pages of (not even really good) erotica.I would recommend that even if you have become a huge fan of the Breeds skip this short story, it doesnt really add anything to the Breed world and the writing wasn't good."
1593,5,"I have always loved Vampires and this story was very good!  The character of Dante is extremely exciting to me.  I loved him in the first story and in this one he was fantastic.  I also really loved Duncan, WOW so HOT!!!!  I can't wait to read the next one in the series, hope it's as good.  Although I do hope that both characters will be in more of the series."
1594,5,I loved this story. Both characters are reluctant and extremely stubborn yet they willingly surrender to each other to make the perfectlove story. Can't wait to read the next one.
1595,4,I loved the characters and stories. Each one was different but they all connected. The romance and love that is shown in the series is great.
1596,3,"Honestly, this book was my least favorite out of all of the Out of Uniform series. For some reason, I just didn't click with the characters. Mac drove me a little nuts because she refused to even entertain the idea of being with Will. Hello?! I wanted to yell, ""He is a hot Navy SEAL and has been your best friend for years....how would you not click as a couple?! How could you not think he wouldn't stand by you and your psychic abilities?"" Anyways, but other than that, I found it a good read. Of course, Will was super sexy and could make a girl swoon.~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~"
1597,3,"This was a good read and have plot twists and turns, which kept the story interesting.  I didn't find too many typos or grammatical and punctuation errors.  Definitely worth taking a look, but the writing style didn't strike me the right way.3 out of 5 stars."
1598,5,Now you have the final sacrifice to save the races.  This is indeed so close to following the teachings of the Bible and it even uses names from the Bible for God and his servants.  Loved this series!
1599,4,"I don't write plot summaries or include spoilers.I really enjoyed reading this book 2 of Ms. Arend's 'Granite Lake Wolves' series, which begins withWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1. Similar to book 1 in that this is a FAST read. Given that, it is pretty satisfying. Good book to read in an afternoon if you just want a little relaxing fun. It would almost be as comforting as a good cup of tea... or is it the other way around?Characters are sweet- more sweet than sexy in this case. Both Missy and Tad come across as people you'd like to have living next door. Despite the fact that I wasn't drooling over them or caught up in their passion, their romance was well done. There was some background between the two which helped provide some depth and their sexual tension was fun to watch unfold. I chuckled in places and sighed in contentment in others.This series does seem a little light on the paranormal side- you don't really get to spend too much time on the shifting or their nature as wolves, but pack politics come into play- and certainly wolf instincts. This book had a bit more magic in it given that the Omega wolf was a key part of the plot.All in all, it's a light, uncomplicated paranormal romance series. Something to read for fun when you have time. It is light and romantic enough to be soothing. I will save the next one for a day when I need a little escape.FURTHER READING: if you like this, you'll like...Moira Rogers' basic werewolf romance series:Cry Sanctuary: Book 1 of Red Rock Pass seriesR.G.

1600,5,"This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy. And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was. However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless. Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities. This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: ""A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts. In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column. Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram.""And how does that help me? one would ask. Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words. Visualization is the key word here. Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story. ""One idea is interconnected with many other ideas,"" we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes. It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process. The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways.""...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become. A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw. Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map. This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind."" Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works. I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try. Well, all that has changed. I now find this subject as intriguing as they come. As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals. I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right. And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose. Is it a self-help manual? In a way it is, but it's much more than that. To use a metaphor I'd say that this is a guide of how to use the GPS of your brain to find the destinations you desperately seek, and need."
1601,4,"I love how Marie Harte clearly shows that she knows how a small town function even if it is on lies and gossip.  I love how Sarah has to deal with all lies and gossip while trying to hold her head up, and how Cullen proves that not everyone listens to back stabbers."
1602,3,not really my thing.  would rather not have the gay thing in my reading.  next time I will pass on her book.
1603,5,"I picked this book up out of curiosity and was very impressed. A few of the stories in the horror section were a bit too graphic for my taste, but they were very clearly marked and all of the stories certainly left an impression.  The first section of the stories involved characters from Mr. Konrath's ""Jack Daniels"" crime series.  The stories could be followed without any knowledge of the series and they interested me enough that the first book of the series is on my Kindle waiting to be read. I'll definitely read more books by this author."
1604,5,"Shifter romance.  My favourite so far in this series and that's saying something.  A romance between a Puma and a werewolf Alpha.  Let the games begin!  Loved this story, good characters and well written.  Fantastic."
1605,4,This is a fun example of the timewhen writers were paid by the word and quantity was a living.
1606,5,"This book has it all: time tunnel to the future, a super terrific submarine, working lasers, computer links in your minds, Mars station finding an alien artifact,, Love, and lives being prolonged. Of course there's always the other side of the coin. Future human who wants to be ""The Ruler Of It All"", angry scientist, murder, plots to kill, nuclear winter, changed Pacific coastline and Love lost. Great plot, good timeline between Earth before and after the time ""event""."
1607,5,"I enjoyed reading this book.  It was fairly well written. It kept one wondering what was actually going to happen even thoughone could assume, by the title that they would get back together."
1608,3,"I liked that this book was funny, sweet and senual with just enough spice to make it interesting. No high drama or misunderstandings. The h/h were two adults who knew what they wanted and didn't play games to get it."
1609,4,A selection of stories that make you think or space operas that can send you into tomorrow adventures or interdimensional travels.
1610,1,"I bought this item when i first bought my kindle dx(i LOVE my kindle dx)after having it for a little over 4 months i noticed it cracked my kindle dx and its so not worth the $40 i paid for it,i had to go and buy another case for my kindle and only paid $15 for it and its not ruining my kindle."
1611,5,Loved it can't wait for the next book. If you enjoyed the other books in this series you will most definitely love this boo
1612,4,"I enjoyed this piece of fiction. The author created an exciting world, a magical reality that exists side by side with the human reality. The heroine , Callie, is well developed and interesting. The two brothers she bags, are smoking hot. A good fun read. Definately recommended for a short read."
1613,4,"intriguing characters try to decode mysterious happenings in old house (filled with even more mystery).  Sparks fly, tensions build, and as readers of Beth Kery already know...hot steamy romance.  loved it!"
1614,2,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot, and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting, but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes, but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat, causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario, the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos, and misspelled or missing words. Given the above, this is not a book I would highly recommend."
1615,5,"I have no idea why I enjoyed this book so much. It was filled with a lot of detail about a complicated world and half the time I had no idea what was going on. Also, the characters are ""deir"" not men, which is a very important distinction. Still lassen was just such a sweetie pie, it was filled with intrigue and good 1980s-1990s romance drama and tension and it was just great fun I did not want to put it it down even though right now it's midnight and I'm like wtf did I just read?!"
1616,2,"The story deserves five stars but it already exists as part of the book  ""All the Rage"".  The publishers just lifted out this chapter, tweaked a couple of minor points, and then rereleased it as a separate story.  Definitely not cool.  Or maybe ""the Otherness"" had something to do with it.  Either way, Repairman Jack would be pissed."
1617,1,Not really into the whole werewolf scenarios.  I may be one of very few whole had no interest in the whole Twilight thing.  This book was free and a quick read is the only reason I read it.  I think if the werewolf story line was left out I would have given it a better review.  Just not my cup of tea
1618,4,This was a short novella and it had good tempo! Bargaining with the devil sometimes makes strange bedfellows (no pun intended)
1619,4,"When Jill Delaney is passed over for a coveted promotion she impulsively quits her job - and regrets it immediately.  With few employment prospects and no savings to speak of, things are looking pretty bleak.  To top things off she manages to dent a car in the supermarket parking lot. The car's owner, Ethan Cooper, may be good looking, but he's wound too tight for Jill's taste.  Besides, he seems to have taken an instant dislike to her which was not helped when Jill inadvertently insulted his mother.  Some guys are just so...touchy.Ethan is still reeling from a cheating ex who managed to bankrupt him before she divorced him.  The last thing on his mind is romance, especially one involving the ditzy (but undeniably hot) blonde who had a major meltdown in the parking lot.  Nope, Jill Delaney is definitely not on his agenda - it's too bad that certain parts of his anatomy haven't gotten the memo!But there's nothing like a senior bus trip to Orlando to make a little no-strings-attached vacation sex seem like a good idea.  After all, what could possible go wrong????This is a short read - novella length - but there's plenty of story packed into it.  Jill and Ethan are fully developed characters and (as usual) Shannon Stacey creates a realistic male lead who dodges most of the romance novel stereotypes.  Ethan's exterior may scream ""handsome but dull - a little uptight"" but in the bedroom? - well, that's a totally different story.  This guy is hot, hot, hot - even if it does make him blush... and I just loved that!I liked the chemistry between Jill and Ethan and their dialog was well written.  There's a lot of humor, which was nicely done and there's a scene with Ethan and his mom on the telephone that made me laugh.  When it comes to ""mom"", most men are really just little boys at heart.I've read several books by this author and I have to say that she turned the heat up a notch in this one.  There's explicit sexual language and content, which is nicely balanced out with believable characters and a fun and humorous storyline.  So if most of your road trips this Summer have been spent entertaining bored kids and scouting out the next rest stop, then treat yourself to this sexy little vacation romp.  I promise nobody will be asking ""are we there yet?""."
1620,5,"I loved this book. It was interesting due to the fact that it took Sir James a LONG time to respond to Rachel in any kind of a sexual manner. He deals with her training in an almost ""clinical"" way. The reader is unaware that the Dom is falling for the sub through a good portion of the book. I also liked that this book dealt honestly with some of the practical issues of cleanliness of being a sub. As always Sierra captures the true spirit of a D/s relationship. Worthy book to read."
1621,5,A lot of juiciness within 24 hours!!!!!! I very  much like! I held my breath hoping the character of the leading man would not be a disappointment.
1622,3,this story was published in another book.  it is available at the public library.  if the price was 99 cents i would say buy it and avoid the trip to the library. it is not worth $3.99.  But it is a good stand alone story.
1623,5,if you love comedy romance like i do this is definitely the book for you. the main characters are both funny and lovable. best yaoi book I've read i ages.
1624,4,"Demetria is a character that we can all relate to and the magical kingdom she works to beautify (she's Master Gardener) and protect is a place we would all like to visit.  Demetria's strength is her intelligence, compassion and willingness to get doing what needs doing to make her home safe and comfortable.These stories are the perfect length to enjoy either on their own in little bites or all at once.  You can read one while waiting for the laundry to be done or enjoy all between favorite full-length novels.I'm with Granny above, try them, they are tasty little treats!"
1625,4,"I think this is the best Freya North book I've read so far.  I couldn't put it down for the first half.  The heroine was an attractive character and though I couldn't really identify with her seeming lack of basic common sense in some areas, North's manages to hook you and get you invested in her happy ending.  The Hero, Joe, however was the most interesting.  His journey from being the aloof commitment-phobe ""player"" to faithful one-girl-guy was very well done.  There were moments which bothered me but which were ultimately realistic (SPOILER ALERT:  I'm referring to his continuing with Nathalie even though he'd already begun something with Tess.  END SPOILER ALERT) and made the book that much more interesting.  The whole thing is very satisfying and this is one of the best contemporary romances/chick-lit books I've read in a while.  Though I loved it and couldn't put it down, I have to admit that most people would probably find the second half a bit too long.  There was a bit too much emphasis on the bridge metaphor (Joe builds bridges for a living) and there was a bit too much repetition which should have been better edited.  That said, this is one of Freya North's best books.  Loved it!"
1626,1,Michael and Emma and Lucien and Jane. This novel contains a certain amount of intrigue. The characters are only half developed. Lucien and Jane should have been in a separate book. This with A Wager are novellas at best.
1627,3,"I loved the first one of the series and thought what a great start.  After reading 2 more I was dissappointed.  THey all read the same.  Same story line and same ending,  guy meets girl, girl sleeps with guy, he saves her from evil, they sleep together some more and live happily every after.  Great sex scenes though"
1628,4,This was a HOT HOT HOT read!  I love that these two were friends first and that they hid their attraction. I also loved how they were so comfortable with each other to share their every fantasy!  Will definitely be reading more.
1629,4,"Hailey Jennison was uncomfortable with her body, and had always been shy because of it.  She had developed early, and had to constantly deal with unwanted attention from men.  She didn't go out very often, but did enjoy getting together with her friends on Friday nights.  They had recently become obsessed with a neighbor that provided an exciting sideshow for them.  He is a construction worker named Gage Warren with an incredibly sculpted body he didn't mind showing them frequently.  One night when Gage caught them looking in his windows, they scattered, but not fast enough because before she knew it Hailey had been dragged to his apartment.  He had been attracted to Hailey from the first moment he saw her, and now that he saw his chance, he was going to take it.After they had been together a couple of weeks, Hailey finally told him what he had known all along.  She was afraid he would leave if they didn't have sex, and equated it to her dad leaving her when she was just a small child.  Gage couldn't believe she didn't get it.  He was completely in love with her, and now he just had to get her to believe it.  There was no way he would let her get away.Gage and Hailey are a fun couple.  Hailey has a lot of issues to work out, but Gage loves her and is willing to wait as long as it takes so they can be together forever.  His family is also priceless.  Most people have meddlesome family members, but the fact that two of his work in the mental health field, make the dynamics even more comical since they feel compelled to constantly give advice."
1630,5,Wonderful books .vampire  lovers fantasy will be loved by vampire readers. Have other maggot Shayne books she is one of my favorites
1631,4,"I actually really liked this story, but of course I'm somewhat biased since I love Ms. Vaughn's books.  Even though I felt that the heroine was a total doormat to everyone in her office, the hero and even her live-in cousin, I think she finally redeemed herself at the end. Love the inner dialogue as well when the heroine tells off certain people in her office.  Sometimes I'm thinking the same thing when people are intruding upon my work time as well.  Recommended read."
1632,5,"Oh, what can I say?? The summary for the book is exactly what you will get. Jilly the plus size girl will get 'accidently' kidnapped instead of her sister. And boy oh boy will she enjoy herself. Of course you know her sister has picked out/planned just the most outrageous of all stuff that she's wanted to try out. And if Jilly will just say the safe word it will all stop. Of course- she's not really Sabrina, so she doesn't know the safe word.Now, I know, I would think that in the real world if such a service existed that one would actually have the uh- client say the safe word as a practice, just to ensure that they remembered it or something, no? But that would ruin the whole book!! And the rules state, no dating clients ever.So, he is liking his time with her, and thinks this is all he can have of her. She knows she's decieving him (after her initial shock).It's really cute. You know what's coming- but you can't wait!!"
1633,5,"I really enjoyed reading the first book in the Badlands Series about Logan, Derick, Miranda, Clyde & Clarissa all of them are looking forward to meeting there mail-order bride and or there new husbands. The story starts out with Logan & Derrick waiting at the train station for their mail-order bride that they specifically picked named Miranda, now this is the seventh day and she still hasn't shown and neither one wants to go back to their ranch without her. Finally after about two hours of waiting the train whistle can be heard, the guys are anxiously awaiting when the train pulls up and several people get off and leave but no Miranda. So when the conductor gets off they ask him and he says, &#34;I don't know, but I'm in a hurry to fetch the sheriff because at the last bridge a young woman jumped off the train, while we were moving very fast. According to a young woman behind the conductor it was in fact Miranda who jumped. Just great now what are we supposed to do, we don't have a wife now! Clarissa felt bad for these two guys they were both very good looking but very different, one was dark haired and one was light haired she hoped her intended was as good looking as these two. While she was deep in thought the lawyer Jasper who brought her out for Clyde came around the bend, and said I'm sorry Clarissa your intended couldn't wait for you and he got married a couple of days ago, &#34;What am I supposed to do now&#34; I have no money and I can't go back to New York. Logan piped up, hey we don't have a bride either how about you spend the day with us and see if you would like to marry me. Jasper got all indignant and said &#34;no you don't want to get involved with these two they are looking for something different&#34;, Derick said be quite Jasper let the lady decide. In the mean time Derick moved in close to Clarissa and said if you marry Logan you get me as your husband as well, she looked up shocked, but thought about it and said okay I'll spend the day with you. So as they started to walk away, she said okay I'll marry you, so they stopped at the church and Logan married Clarissa and she became Mrs. Granger. Read this book because you will laugh, cry and cum a whole lot. It takes a lot for a person to give up everything and get on a train and travel for several days or weeks to the middle of know where and marry somebody sight unseen. I'm looking forward to reading the next two books in this series."
1634,4,"The main male character is rich, gorgeous, powerful and sexy...but not a jerk! What a nice change. Instead of using his power to force himself on a woman, he actually romances her. Novel concept for most of these ""billionaire"" type books. The only complaint is that there is too much about her working, working, working. I liked Michael better than Darcy."
1635,1,"This ""book"" contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to, maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh, and of course the obligatory link to the author's other ""books"".Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover, title-page, a couple of blank pages, and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
1636,3,If you like to look up words in the dictionary this is the book for you. Very long book hard to keep going.
1637,5,"It kept me hooked from page 1 till the end. Steamy scenes, great plot, and very romantic. love all her books"
1638,5,"I'm not fairy tales redux, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in one sitting. This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot,the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior, but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice, but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So, I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn."
1639,5,"this book is the 1st book in this series not the 2nd. ""called by blood"" is the 2nd book. because in this book Alex(the baby brother) who is in ""called by blood"" is not mated yet. ""called by blood"" is alex's story.. Okay this FYI is for those who have not read the series and ur going by how the books are listed, just as I did.Moving on... This book was awesome! I have to say Gregor & Maddy are adorable! I really really felt for this couple and am happy they got their HEA. This story is alot more detailed and involved with these two as individuals, and their fears. What they feel is there duty/responsiblity to their families and themselves. Plus the plot/what brings them together and helps carry them is really good. So far this series is really good, and I'm about to start the last book"
1640,5,"Since I got my kindle, I have reread very few books.This one, though, I have had to read twice already.The build ups are great, but the book moves quickly - I really enjoy the intrigue and hope for another from this group of characters."
1641,5,This book shows how some times spicing up ones marriage can make all the difference in the world. I'm glad I read this book.
1642,5,"When I started this book, I had the feeling to read one of my favorite old sweet romance. I confess, I was an avid reader of those old Harlequin Present series, above all the Long Tall Texan series by Diana Palmer. In those romance, the hero was always an handsome and wealthy Long Tall Texan rancher and the heroine was always some sweet virgin, and often it was some family friend's daughter, or a neighbor, or the foster child hosted on the ranch. A bit of age difference was requested, but not so much to be insurmountable. Usually the two lovers were aware of their feelings soon enough, but the wiser and older hero was reluctant to take advantage of someone he considered under his protection.The Convenient Husband is all of this. Tucker is the oldest son of a Texan rancher; he built his life far from the ranch, but he was often back home to visit, at least until Micah reached his 18 years old. Micah was the nephew of the ranch's foreman, and he has always lived on the ranch since 4 years old. And he was always the shadow of Tucker. But on his 18 years old birthday Micah was suddenly the forbidden fruit and Tucker surrendered to temptation. A night of passion, Micah still a virgin, was enough to make Tucker run away; as usually in this story, Tucker thinks he is doing Micah a favor, he is too old and bitter for a young thing like Micah. Problem is that Tucker doesn't realize that, in a isolated ranch in Texas, there are not so many chance of hapinnes for a gay boy like Micah.Four years later Micah needs Tucker to be back home: Tucker's grandfather is dying and he wants his nephew near him; plus the old man's will states that he will leave the ranch to the first of his nephews to marry... even if it's not a legal marriage in Texas. Being both Tucker than Micah gays, the obvious solution is for Tucker to marry Micah, so the young man will be able to remain forever on the ranch, and this time even as a real family member... But once Tucker tastes again the forbidden fruit, will he be able to walk away from him again?The story is mostly funny and it doesn't last long in the life of the two main characters, only few days, but there is a nice Epilogue that let you have a glimpse in their future life. It also avoids almost all the angst usually linked to a gay relationship in a ""unwelcoming"" setting, only one man has something to say against Tucker and Micah's relationship, and inside their home, all other people around are supporting and happy, like it was the only thing they were expecting. So there is no really trouble among Tucker and Micah, if not only a bit of stubbornness from both side, exactly like on those old sweet romance I loved so many years ago. The Convenient Husband is a modern tale with an old sweet feeling. The only bittersweet feeling I had was for Tucker's grandfather, even if he has not really any scenes, he seemed a very interesting man, and it was very sad to see him gone. Also the other old man of the story, Micah's uncle, Juan, reserves a nice surprise to the reader and even to Micah's himself, and in the epilogue, the author hints to a story that I would really like to read, a love story where one of the characters is 69 years old and the other one 35... a may december relationship with plus a silver romance in it... really something the author should consider to write."
1643,5,"This is def one of my new favorite series!  You must read these.  I wasn't into werewolves before, but damn.  I am now!"
1644,5,Wonderful wonderful book I loved each and every word in it. I wonder if Ricard will find a love in a part two of this book I find I need to read more about this game family. How does nikki like Ireland and does she ever get to see her home land again?.
1645,5,"Stacy Daniels's father has been dead to her for years but now that he's finally passed away in reality she has some very difficult decisions to make.  She's been living and working in Great Falls but her father's ranch is where her heart truly lies.

They've done their best to protect her from her father's bullying and hateful attitude.  They've never expressed their feelings to Stacy and now with her father gone they feel it's time for her to come back to the ranch - where she belongs - as their woman.Stacy's guilt over the perceived wrong on being in love with three men is emotionally agonizing.  She's convinced her only option is to sell the beloved ranch and return to Great Falls as soon as possible.  Only first she has to consult the attorney about the property and for some reason the man is never available.  That means she spends a lot of time around the ranch and avoiding Wolfe, Cash and Travis is impossible especially when each of them keeps such a close eye on her.  When each man individually seduces her she becomes even more confused and scared.  Despite the men's insistence that she is home, she's determined to leave and doesn't believe there's any way she can confide in them about her feelings for them all.  As it is she's afraid they're going to find out that's she's cheated on each of them with their own brother.  Only there are things that Stacy doesn't know which will shock and change everything she's ever believed.  Will she stay after learning the truth about the ranch and what her father did?HER DAKOTA MEN takes readers on an emotional journey along with the characters as each comes to grips with their feelings and what they mean for their future.

Wolfe, Cash and Travis are wonderful men who want nothing more than Stacy's happiness - and for her to stay at the ranch.  They're all dominant men by nature and their interactions with Stacy are beyond scorching.  Leah Brooke is a fairly new author, but she's definitely secured herself a place on my auto-buy list.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
1646,3,i think this one was just okay. having a guy push you to give in isn't always the best. and then having it used against you. but finding what u want is good.
1647,4,"This was an enjoyable short erotic style story, that kept me entertained for an afternoon. While it doesn't have the character development a longer novel might have, the author still manages to hold the readers interest. Obviously it is not for everyone, but I found it to be a charming read. I look forward to reading more stories from this author in the future."
1648,4,I enjoyed Vol 2 as much as I did Vol 1.  The mysteries were quite interesting for having been written in the early 1900's.
1649,3,"This book was well written.  However, I read a lot of PNR and this one was ""just ok."" I couldn't really get into it and I never seemed to be able to relate with the characters."
1650,4,Enjoyed this book. The story was well developed . Characters were interesting and likeable. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
1651,5,I am thrilled that I finally found a car charger for my Kindle Fire that actually works...thank you very much!!
1652,5,"This series is very good, not taking anything away from Little Fuzzy or Murder in the Gun Room ( two of my favorites ). Paratime is an imaginative well written series and this collection  of stories are in the original form, some of Pipers stories have been edited by third parties and are some what lacking.  Piper is one of the best classic Sci-Fi writers and well worth reading."
1653,4,"I really liked this book.  The H was vulnerable, but absolutely not wimpy, which I really liked for a change of pace. I thought there was good character development, and no one was doing stupid things just for a dramatic ploy.  Bedroom scenes were hot and you could feel the emotions of the H and h. I would recommend this book."
1654,5,"A clever and well written short story. Done even better then the Masters of Horror that used a similar theme.  What happens if a killer who picks up hitchhikers meets a killer hitchhiker?  Each killer in this story is written by one of the two writers.They don't see what the other one wrote until they finally bring it together. A great way to really shock and take the reader for a ride. If the writer doesn't know whats happening no way the reader can.When two remorseless killers do try and one up each other, who do you root for? Who's way of killing wins out? Two is always better then one and this story really delivers the goods. No dead parts or boring filler, just out the gate goodness.I am VERY much looking forward to reading many more books by these guys.Brandon"
1655,4,"Interesting characters, a disaster with an atypical twist, and well placed action made this a fun read. There were a few grammatical errors, and fewer characters would have allowed for stronger  overall character development. The author provided helpful scientific background without bogging the reader down. I randomly checked some of the scientific information and it seemed accurate. Overall, I had such fun reading this that I will read it again; I love disaster books or movies."
1656,4,"This was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.It was well written.  The world is described with  enough detail to really come alive for me but not too much to ever get boring. It was fast paced and there was plenty of action yet at the same time there was a lot of character development where you got to know everyone, especially Marc and Blake.You feel Marc and Blake's love and protectiveness for each other but also frustration, annoyance, disappointment, betrayal, rejection and much more.  They and their emotions feel very real. Marc is more mature and responsible than Blake (and is his Sire) but he has made mistakes in the past which have damaged their relationship. Blake has a lot of insecurities when it comes to Marc. He has  trouble taking anything seriously and has a lot of growing up to do. Even though they are powerful vampires they have some human flaws which make them real.There are plenty of other characters in the story too, most human. Both Marc and Blake fall for Rose as she is not just a pretty face but gains their respect for being such a good fighter. She is a strong independent individual and one of the leaders in her squad. This is new for Blake and it causes him to care for  a human for the first time. This slowly changes him and makes him see things differently. He becomes a better person for it. For Rose the attraction is mutual and she has trouble coming to terms with being attracted to both of them. You're definitely left with the idea that Rose could be what Blake and Marc need to help bring them together and keep them together healing old wounds and bringing excitement and hope for their future.Even though it is clear the story will continue it ends at a good point so the story still feels complete in its own right. I would definitely recommend this story."
1657,3,The movie prompted me to buy the book which I found quite engrossing for the first half.  I managed to read on for about a qrt of the 2nd half then gave up as the story theme became repetative.  A younger reader would most probably stay with it to the end.
1658,5,"Very good author cute romantic book, great Valentine read. Wish it was longer. Will get more of her books. Enjoy"
1659,5,"I like short stories such as these, that are brutalin their simplicity and smack you right between theeyes, no mucking about with back story that putyou on the somnabulent elevator.Twilight Zone on steroids baybuh!"
1660,5,"WELL WRITTEN AND A GREAT STORY LINE.  IT COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE MORE INTERACTION WITH THE CREATURES OR ENTITIES FROM THE FOG, BUT OTHER THAT IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING TO READ"
1661,4,"This was a wonderful, ""page"" turning ebook. I started reading it at 11pm last night. Bad mistake. I didn't get to sleep until 2am! I had to finish the book. ""Hallowed"" is along the same lines as ""Jekyll and Hyde"" as well as James Byron Huggins' ""Cain."" Pretty good story. A little unbelievable and over the top at parts, but it IS science fiction."
1662,5,"Pretty neat book! I enjoyed the manner in which all the loose ends were tied up.  Knowing there are more books to follow in this series, it is not as though you are the edge of a cliff!The solar powered car is incredible.  Talk about an arsenal at your fingertips!Also, a lot of information on staying alive after a disaster.Highly recommended!"
1663,5,"A great collection of short stories ranging from locked-room mysteries to horrors to parody and satyre :) That being my first &#34;meeting&#34; with J. A. Konrath I have to say I can't wait to read any of his full-length novels.I am not a fan of short stories (I kind of get attached to the main characters in a novel and hate to part with them too quckly) and definitely not a fan of horrors (my imagination being too vivd, obviously:)), but nonetheless I found all the stories in &#34;65 Proof&#34; at least intriguing, and most of them really amusing. I loved the twists and the humour, although I probably sometimes missed on the cultural/local puns - as I am not a native-speaker of English, which has not in the least taken any joy and fun from the reading:DDefinitely a must for anyone who likes intelligent, somewhat crazy and funny story-telling:D"
1664,5,Darth Maul working under cloak of darkness committing sabotage now that is a story worth reading many times over.  Great story.
1665,5,"I loved this book too. It is hard not to. Misty has so much going on in her books within the same story line. I started the book yesterday and finished it today. I wanted to find a good ""break"" in the story so that I could put the book down and do other things but I couldn't.  She writes in such a way that you just keep reading and reading. I really enjoyed Michael and Brigit's relationship in this book. It developed so well and I even had tears in my eyes when Brigit didn't want Michael to leave in a certain scene. I loved how they both wanted to protect each other and how well they could relate based on their pasts. The story in this one was better than I anticipated (I have a tough time reading about kidnappings since I am a mother and that is such a fear). It flowed well and was a lot bigger than the kidnapping mentioned in the summary, so for those worried about that, rest assured you can read this one without any problems. I also liked that the characters from the other books played a role in this book (Conrad & Julia, Lawson & Zara, etc). I adore Del and Ace in this series, too. There are just so many things about this series that I enjoy it is hard to list them all in the review and I would have to continue starting each sentence with ""I liked"" or ""I loved"", so I'll end here. :) If you have read the other Super Agent books you will love this one! Highly recommended!"
1666,5,This book kept my interest from start to finish. If you enjoy fiction you will enjoy this book. Well done.

1668,5,"Will Charleston has wanted Mackenzie Wade from the moment they met back in high school.  Fifteen years later, Will is still relegated to the role of best friend; a role he's tired of playing.  With a single kiss, Mackenzie changes everything.  It's the breakthrough Will's been waiting for, and this time he's not taking no for an answer.Mackenzie has come to rely on Will's friendship and no amount of lust is going to make her risk their friendship.  Her psychic gift has brought more than one relationship to a crashing halt, and though Will swears he'd never leave her, Mackenzie still fears taking that chance.  When a storm brings Will to her doorstep, Mackenzie finds she can't resist the heat between them.  A night of passion leads to further complications when Mackenzie experiences a tragic vision of the future.  Resolutely guarding her heart, Mackenzie tries to put Will back in the ""friend zone.""  But Mackenzie is about to learn firsthand just how determined her sexy SEAL can be.Love, lust, and longing fulfilled come together in the deliciously erotic Heat of the Storm.  There is just something so appealing about a man willing to fight for his love.  Perhaps that's why Will is one of, if not my absolute favorite hero of Elle Kennedy's.  Having met Will in the previous Out of Uniform stories, I was anxious for his story, eager to see what kind of hero he would be.  I loved discovering that his quiet exterior concealed a deep sensuality.  He also grabbed my heart with his absolute certainty of his love for Mackenzie, his willingness to wait for her, and his knowing when he had to say ""enough is enough.""  Though I wished I could snatch Will up myself, Ms. Kennedy made me understand why Mackenzie was so reticent to fully give her heart to Will.  Still, I rooted for the moment when Mackenzie realized she had to take that step, that holding Will at arm's length was not the right answer to her problems.Heat of the Storm is the third book in Ms. Kennedy's fantastic Out of Uniform series.  Each story in the series stands on its own, but having read Heat of the Moment and Heat of Passion, I was delighted that I got to revisit my favorite characters from those two books.  In the end, all I can say is that I absolutely adored Heat of the Storm.  Will and Mackenzie's romance touched my heart even as their passion stole my breath.  Ms. Kennedy never fails to deliver an incredible romance and I finished Heat of the Storm wonderfully satisfied, wanting nothing more than to read another Out of Uniform tale.ShaynaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1669,4,"I LOVE the NY TIMES and have been a at-home subscriber for 10-12 years, but that method is not cheap.  Two people in our household have iPads and starting reading it there.  I liked what I saw and when I got a Kindle Fire HD I switched over.  I still love the Times but the iPad app is nicer - it looks like the paper's front page - whereas the Kindle app is not as nice.  I still believe all the content is there and I read it daily and I love the fact that it costs only a third of home delivery but I do miss seeing the front page view.  On the Kindle it comes up as a series of stories.  Once you click on a story, then you do get the pictures and it looks even better than the newsprint because of color but believe it or not I miss all those gorgeous full page adds in the Times!  There are no ads on my Kindle version but the iPads do get some kind of ads but not the ones in the hardcopy paper.  I give the Kindle App 3 or 4 stars but the Times itself always gets 5 stars from me.  You can't get that news anywhere else.  I hope Amazon improves the app so that my iPad family members can stop snickering!"
1670,5,"I can't remember how I stumbled upon this book but I'm so glad I did! It was an interesting read and provided hours of entertainment via hanging on the edge of my seat! This book has a lot of action but it also has a great &#34;book worm&#34; factor with all of Abby's research. I really like how the author incorporated alot of truthful tidbits into the story, several of which I hadn't run across in the general knowlege base of Kennedy conspiracies. It wasn't a rehash and even though some of the action was a bit unbelivable and I had a hard time accepting some of the later characters like Rob and Demetrius, overall it was a very solid book with good strong lead characters. I think a few more sprinklings of &#34;the times&#34; would have made it more authentic- several of the later scenes in the college town felt too modern for me, seeing as how the story took place in the early 80s, but maybe that's just me! Pick it up- it's totally worth the $3!!"
1671,4,"I enjoyed this book.  It is not your typical adventure novel, since it takes place in Iowa and Nebraska (not your your typical hot spots of high adventure criminal activity) and the protagonists aren't special operators.  It is a fun read, and I hope Mr. O'Kane makes a series of it.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers, but I would recommend reading it - especially if you get it on a day it is free or you can get it for $0.99.  I love finding gems for those prices."
1672,5,"In Chicago, her five overly protective older brothers and her Italian parents are driving Lottie Santori crazy as they leave her with no breathing room.  Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).  The trouble with this novel is that Leslie Kelly will keep her audience up late reading in one sitting.Harriet Klausner"
1673,4,"The second book on the Wizards trilogy continues well, as the Daughter of the boy in the first book finds her way to Kimyra to deal with troubles left over from her father's visit years before.  Using her knowledge of Earth technology, she rapidly becomes a capable user of that left by the ancients, and thus the Red Wizard by local standards.  Along the way she learns important lessons involving lying and responsibility.  A good series for a teen to read, and not too bad for an adult."
1674,4,"I have to agree with another reviewer that most of the other Konrath I have read has been far better than what I read in this short story anthology. However, some of the stories were great, and I especially Like Phin and Jack Daniels. All in all I had a blast, so thank you Mr. Konrath, from one of your devoted fans."

1676,4,"Want a romance that intertwines the best of drag racing and heart pounding love? Then grab a copy of Out of Control, by Julie Miller. Your heart and adrenaline will race!She thinks she's an ugly duckling in a man's world. He's trying to catch the person who killed his partner. Their paths cross on a street in Nashville for one amazing night and never to cross again... or so they think. Cars aren't the only thing racing out of control at the Dahlia Speedway.I liked that Alex possessed the physical features of a vixen yet she didn't know that to do with those same attributes. She shows that all women can be sexy regardless of her status in life. Grease monkeys and gear heads can be very saucy. I also liked that Jack wasn't a typical cop/detective. He played by the rules - his own. His take charge attitude helped smooth over his possessiveness and made him more likable.The writing was tight and the descriptions of the speedway made you feel like you were a real part of the story. I enjoyed every minute of the journey.If you want a great summer read, filled with racing heart and racing cars, then Out of Control if the read for you. I give this novel 4.5 books.[...]"

1679,3,"I'm conflicted about this book.  Don't misunderstand me about the surprise on reviews, I do like the book.  However, the continuity and details made it very hard for me to give this a good rating.  Fey have long life expectancy from what the first book states.  Sorry for the spoiler, but I'm stating this because it IS in the first book.  Betina is proof of that.  Although, I think because she is High Priestess and Fey, it makes her life expectancy a tad longer.  But Duncan is also half Fey, and he has a long life too.  Then there is the fact of what Megan is.  I won't spoil it, but the fact it is stated she is mortal: makes no sense!  She should be just as supernatural as the next.  She is what she is: mixed, but that doesn't make her any less supernatural.Aside from that, I sort of like Dante. I was more into Duncan in this one.  From what I could tell his character takes the magic aspect like Allie and Betina did.  My other issue is Duncan not using flashing them to safety.  Uh, what happened to that ability?  Did he lose that yet still conjures up glowing swords?  And the bit about using something as means to get rid of poison?  Why is it in the first book, this was not used?  Silver is just as much a poison to vampires and weres and there was no need for what Duncan says helps rid poison from their body.  It was inconsistent to the first book.  Or maybe just an excuse to have multiple partners, but still make this a book on a couple.  I'm going to say yes it was used just for that.  Which is just plain horrible to use Duncan in this sense.  He was imprisoned and released in the previous book by Allie...yet he is used in this one.  Kinda horrible that he couldn't find happiness in this book especially considering a detail that is found out about a character.  I just think he got short changed BIG TIME.  Then again he deserves better.Megan.  What to say about her.  I liked her, but I didn't love her like I adored Allie.  She is constantly back and forth with feelings.  Let me emphasize.  She makes it very clear she feels something for Dante at some point.  Won't say when.  But right away you can tell B. D'arc is making this only about two of the characters and not a trio.  However, she does throw in the sharing aspect quite a bit.  At which point pisses me off at times.  Inner voices are basically laying down just who that couple should be.  Yet, you wonder about the one character who saves them continuously.  I just don't understand why this couldn't have included Duncan also. Given how close Dante and Duncan are. And don't get me wrong I get being a good friend, but that?  Yeah, that was taking the friendship to an entirely different level.  Sure they were mature about it, but it squeaked me out more than the twin brothers in the first book. I got that, and even excepted it.  This? I don't know, unless at some point she plans to make books about what Duncan's character actually is.  It's stated in the first book that he is a Knight and half Fey.  So maybe a bunch of Knights and half Fey or Knights and Fey get there own set of books aside from this series?  Because it seems to me we won't see Duncan getting his own book anytime soon.  So yeah, he was written in a way that he was used big time.  Aggravated me.  Probably why it's taking me so long to read this.  It's losing my interest.  And probably because I saw better chemistry when all three were together, but hey, just my opinion, I guess.I didn't find this book as hot as the first and I'm not a big fan of twins with the same woman.But I'm not finished and pushing through this book even though I'm not as immersed as I was with the first.  So I will update.Update:The inconsistencies are a big problem for me.  Another is the very fact she discusses not using the backdoor during sex...yet she has done this.  It's like the act is happening for the very first time at every sexual interaction they have.  It's highly annoying.  I'm surprised no one noticed this at all.  Another spoiler from the last book.  Don't read this unless you've read the first.  But my issue is that there is so much emphasis on the fact Dante got rid of a character that is of importance to a family in this one, yet he aided.  It was Allie the Priestess who banished that character whom Dante is being blamed for.  That was a very big pet peeve how that wasn't argued with the bad villains of the story.  They knew what Patrick was up to, yet they don't follow through and assume it's Dante?  Dante helped, along with Duncan, but it was ultimately Allie who banished this Patrick.  This character is the reason behind a revenge vendetta against Dante.  I understand why they think it's him...BUT they are so wrong.  And why when it does get pointed out it wasn't him, it's brushed off.  I get the reasons for going after Dante, because I won't say that spoiler, but seriously they needed to go to the source too.  (maybe this will come up in later books, I hope?)Too many things just weren't consistent with the truth of the first book.  I had a very hard time with a certain joining too.  There was nothing spectacular about it.  Just words spoken of We are one.  Yet, Dante shares a bond with Tim from the first book and even more so with Duncan from the first book and even this book.  I'm going to spoil this right now so read at your own discretion: But given there was sex between Duncan, Megan, and Dante at one point.  To control Dante's urge to feed he bit Duncan.  Um, I've read quite a few vampire bonding books, but this was very very weak.  It would mean that Dante bonded with anyone he slept with.  This one business was, too me, a cop out.  Automatically joining them.  I didn't find it romantic at all.  I found it too convenient so that it was just the two.  As I'm sure it was intended to begin with.  I really wished I did find it romantic and a great joining, but I didn't.  But this book wasn't anywhere in the same caliber as the first of this series.  That joining between Tim/Allie/Rafe was believable.  I kinda want to grab Duncan out of this book and give him something 100 times better than these two.  D'arc definitely throws him to the side, but loves to tell you the reader that he's okay with it.  I wouldn't have been.  I still have an issue that she changed how magic users rid poison.  It just didn't fit.  I still believe it was to add the spice of multiple partners.  Because come on!  How the heck can a poisoned nearly dying vamp manage to have sex????  Yeah I'm not going to totally spill on that scene, but seriously?  It makes you wonder how this technique of ridding poison wasn't used in Lord's of the Were when Duncan shows up.  I'm just stumped how details can change so quickly from each book.  Yes, I'm into details and certain details done jive with the first book.Final Update:I'm hoping this isn't the case with the rest of the Were series because I totally loved the first book!  And now finishing this story...finally, I'm still very much conflicted.  A lot didn't add up to the previous book.  I wonder how the ending will come about if we don't see much of a certain character being tagged by a certain familiar.  The joining between these two Dante and Megan, was kinda cheesy and way too romanticized to be believable at times.  And I'm still smarting about the fact that she needs to be something else.  She is part something, part were, and part human.  She should have long life expectancy, yet I think we are to assume she doesn't, which negates what we read in the first book.  I just don't get that.  Some things with these details just boggled my mind.  I'm sorry I tried to like this story.  A lot of it was telling with some bits of it showing then right back to telling. I don't know some things were contradicting the first story and then this one takes on a new leaf, so to speak.  I get making two characters the be all, but it was overly done. Kinda like without you, we are so dead, it's up to these two. Yet, when it was done for the Lords of the Were, it was tastefully done.  It worked. For these two it was pushed and pushed.  You find yourself really pulling for another trio to come together, but it's NOT going to happen.  Yet, he does MORE heroic and amazing things during this entire book, and he amazed me the most aside from some special characters that came on the scene!  I was not connecting well with Megan or Dante in this story.  I swear even with the first part of the book, I wanted Duncan to find his happiness.  And, at this point, I don't think we will see it any time soon.  Unless of course it's thrown in there in later stories just to conclude his part in all of this.  Rather sad, because I connected so much to him in the first book and this book.No doubt most won't agree with me, but the details killed me.  Given the fact that I'm into details, this was disappointing because I do like Bianca's work.  I hope to enjoy the rest of the series.  I recommend read if you aren't a detail wolf like me (lol), but I am not like the others with their praise for this book.  I failed to review the last book, because I wanted to read this one.  And I don't review every book either.  This one I had to say something.  I was really into Dante in the first book.  This one he literally died in my eyes.  No connection. So yeah, disappointment.  I hope Rocky is better!"
1680,4,"I love these supernatural stories by Anderson.  They are all interesting, well written and HOT.  The s a great quick read"
1681,3,The characters are very likable and I like the idea of friends become lovers and the writer did a good job of capturing the tension but I still felt disappointed with the plot; it was paper thin. So I recommend this book if u want a quick sexy read but this book was too short to have any real depth.
1682,3,"Not bad, but not memorable. A really good read makes you smile even a few days after you read it."
1683,2,"I've read several of this author's books and have enjoyed them, but this one was disappointing.  I couldn't get past the fact that although the heroine was trying to reach her pregnant sister who was very possibly stranded in a raging flood and near going into labor, the heroine and hero indulged in several passionate make out sessions - this after seeing each other for the first time since High School.  The story line seemed drawn out and predictable - the hero had just lost his best friend who drowned in a flood, and the same thing nearly happens to the heroine.  Not one of this author's best."
1684,3,Read these books after seeing the movie.The structure of some of the books makes it difficult to read. The plot is adventurous and fun if youa wanted to know what happened after seeing the movie.
1685,5,"This is Vivian Arend's second visit to Granite Lake and the wolves that live there. Having read the first book, I was intrigued to see where she would take me with this visit. This is first and foremost a love story more than anything. That the main characters just happen to be wolves at times takes nothing away from that. I love Granite Lake,the richly detailed scenic areas that these stories are set in. Ms. Arend's character development is nothing short of superb. I love the gentle strength and determination that Missy displays when she is faced with trouble. She doesn't run away, she just works toward her goals. I giggled a bit when Tad was called to the Granite Lake pack and told there was someone willing to Firstmate with him and he was sure it was an older, blue haired woman he had seen at gatherings. The pleasant surprise he felt when he learned Missy was the one offering was genuinely portrayed, as was his relief. And the misunderstanding that arose when Tad tried to be noble and not force a bond on Missy, thinking she had a chance to meet her true mate was humorous, although quite painful for Tad in the end. When the confrontation with the nasty alpha comes, it is an interesting situation. Do Tad and Missy have their happily ever after? Yes, but it is hard won in the end. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves action, romance and a side order of humor along the way."
1686,2,"On a scale of should i sit with the kids and play majong or should i read this book. know i know i should have sat with kids and played majong. The book tried to keep you in the sci-fy with an added kick of some hot n sweaty sex with an alien. It turned into skinny odd furry alien doctor against fat mean furry self abosorbed ass asking for our leading lady's hot sex. It was not hot, just odd. Nope this was a hurry up and get through it read. there are better hotter and wetter sci-fy erotica."
1687,5,"Heather Killough-Walden is a very creative and daring writer. She makes great dialogue, unexpected twists, memorable and lovable characters (even the antagonists), and all her plots are very well written.  I've been following her for years, along with other fans who discovered her in some of the first websites she contributed to.  Like many of them, and those who have found her through recommendations, she has quickly became the top ""favorite"" and to me the main reason why I kept on going back to those websites, waiting for the next installments to her stories which are always in the fantasy or sci-fi realm, although sometimes they were also very sensual.Hell Bent is more action-thriller though, and although it's a romance and has lots of sexual tension, it's more PG13 and will leave most adults disappointed.  However, it's a book that will keep you on the edge and will make you keep on turning the pages. It will also keep you wishing that you had someone like Jack (if you're a woman, and maybe the gays too) although not with all the dark and bad things about him.  Or maybe those too, because he surely is a very lovable character, as Annabelle is also a very strong lovable character of her own."
1688,5,This s very very good suspense novel. I truly enjoyed it. I did not know how it would end. Got me. Keep up the good work.
1689,2,"...I find the preaching very intrusive, ruining the whole novel, although as a story it would still only merit maybe 3 stars. It was not well-written or tight enough in the action sequences, dragging on and then switching to another thread. Also for an experienced submariner it is hard to understand why the author had to distort so many facts like ships' speeds. I am glad I only borrowed this."
1690,4,"Great story of wanting, romance, sex. I would recommend this book to anyone to read. I can't wait to read another one."
1691,3,"The cover is so hot! I did not expect the book to be so soppy.Everything was just so stereotyped, even the dialogue.The editing was shocking.Maybe the fact that it was written in 1999 had a lot to do with the unsatisfactory reading."
1692,4,"Wow, talk about an in depth look at the human psyche....  Callie is kidnapped and forced into slavery, we follow her journey for 10 years and the end result, for me, was startling.  This was one of those books that I'm still thinking about days after I finished.  An intense, dark, emotional read, but one that I enjoyed."
1693,4,"With a length that skirts the boundaries between what I would consider a short story and novella, If You Believe introduces us to Aubrey Mathison, owner of the coffee shop Bean There, Done That, and Chief of Police Price Delacroix. Aubrey is still damaged from the betrayal of her now ex-husband, and since their divorce she doesn't have relationships with men. She dates and has sex. That's been working out well for her until her life takes a bit of a turn. Suddenly the homeless man across the street is spouting predictions that come true, her coffee shop goes up in flames, and Price Delacroix meets her, wants her, and refuses to be just one of her other men.There's no doubt that the heat between them is incendiary and the sex scenes smoking hot. The story is tightly compact, but due to the length, we get a much better idea of Aubrey as a character than we do Price, who never seems to develop much beyond superficial eye candy. I've read other novellas of this length that focused more on both character's definition, and realize that my preference lies in that area. I'm not criticizing this story, don't get me wrong. I think it was comprehensive, given length-constraints, in detailing Aubrey's character enough to lend her believability, and I enjoyed seeing her interact with her friend the hairdresser and the guardian angel. In fact, had Price's character been given just a bit more definition, I would have really liked this story. As it stands, I think it's better than okay, but just lacked a bit for me to make it truly enjoyable. The sex, though, was stellar. 3.5 Stars."
1694,4,"3.5 stars.I have to confess that I don't really know what to think. There are a lot of wonderful ideas in this story and I think they deserved more space to develop because some of the situations, especially those on the dream plane, faded to black and then came back too abruptly. Instead of the confusion of the main character, I was left only with a sense of disorientation.The setting was really fantastic. The story takes place on a train and the other protagonist is a mysterious man, part magician, part healer. Marco Satori is a very interesting character and he makes you hold your breath when he appears on the page. And he's very sexy.Edwin, from whose point of view we see the story, is melancholic and in need of salvation and Marco gives him awareness and also a spark of will to change the situation he is in.There is a paranormal twist, and it was a big thing, with a lot of information that made me crave for a longer story. I was left with the impression I was given only a teasing, abridged version of a great book.Beautifully written."
1695,4,"Unfortunately, Norbert Davis, the author of OH,MURDER MINE, is not as well known as other pulp fiction writers of the 1940's for three reasons. First, his stories encompassed a wide array of genres, so he never built a reputation as a practitioner of a specific type (e.g. detective, SF, etc.) . Second, his detective stories included a strain of humor which was highly unusual for the period, a hard boiled detective story was not supposed to be funny. Third, he committed suicide at age 40, supposedly after he had been diagnosed with cancer. Thus, his potential literary legacy was truncated. However, among his peers he was regarded as in a class with the best writers of the era, including Hammett and McDonald. He graduated from Stanford with a law degree, but never took the bar exam - choosing instead to pursue a career which he had already established by being published while still in college, usually being paid at the going rate of a penny a word. Hopefully, the advent of ebooks and specialized small presses will allow many more potential fans to enjoy his works and dog lovers will be irresistably drawn to Carstairs' collaborations with Doan.This is the last of Davis' stories featuring the hardboiled detective DOAN and his Sidekick CARSTAIRS, a Great Dane the size of a Shetland Pony. It was published in 1946, and after greatly enjoying the few stories about the duo which were published before Davis' suicide, I feel a sense of loss that the duo's adventures were prematurely ended by Davis' death. Given the obviously boundless limits of Davis' imagination and his keen powers of observation regarding human frailties, the duo easily could have become a staple of the genre.This story takes place on a college campus, where we first meet Melissa Gregory, an anthropolgy instructor at Breckenridge University. She soon has a confrontation Eric Trent, a meterologist who has just joined the faculty, and for whom Doan is acting as bodyguard. Why? You'll have to read the story to discover the answer. They and Melissa's fellow faculty member and boyfriend Frank Ames are the only four relatively normal individuals in a book populated with such characters as among others Professor Sly-Myrick (a refugee from the Gestapo), Heloise of Hollywood (who ""radiated as much warmth as a diamond""), President T. Ballard Bestwyck, the Aldrich twins, Beulah Porter Cowys, Deputy Humphrey (no one is this dumb), Herbert ""Big Tub"" Tremaine, Bumbershoot Bennie, and Sebastian Rodriguez y Ruiz. In addition, Handsome Lover Boy got his name is integral to the plot. Many of these individuals are caricatures rather than characters, but it is all in fun - unless they happen to get killed as several do.Davis' plot involves at least as much misdirection as in the earlier stories, but in this one it seemed almost incidental to his parody of campus life and the convoluted backstories of his characters. At first it was a letdown after reading the earlier stories which were structured more as detective procedurals, but after I realized it was simply a lighthearted episode of the adventures of Doan and Carstairs allowing Davis to poke fun at the culture of the period I was able to just smile and enjoy it.A lot of the humor in this episode is much more slapstick than in the previous stories, at times could have sen this Carstairs being a model for Marmaduke as detective. Relative to the other books in the series, I found it difficult to rate this book, so depending on your interests you might rate it very differently than I did. My rating is composed of the following elements -Humor - 5 starsCarstairs (for dog lovers)- 5 star quality but not enough face time, he and Doan form a good teamParody of Campus Politics - 5 starsWeird Characters -  5 StarsPlot - probably 4 stars if you like misdirectionRomance- an over the top 3 stars, no suspense hereNarrative - 3 starsSo, read this if you want to have fun for a couple of hours! And, of course, Carstairs is his usual superior self and he and Doan once again make an unstoppable duo.Tucker Andersen 6/9/2010"
1696,5,"The Dragon Healer came as Amazon recommended.  It is a novella prequel to the Dragon Knights series.  A world where Knights ride dragons and not slay them.  The setting is Midieval and the sex is hot.  The story was intresting and entertaining enough that I picked up book 1 Maiden flight which intrduces 2 new Knights and Dragons from the same lair, again the sex is hot, but there is a nice progression of the story line.  You can read one or the other first."
1697,4,"Reading all these years later what Poul Anderson so skillfully wrote reminded me once again of the treasure trove we are lucky enough to have from those original science fiction masters.  The writing is smooth, concise and believable.  Excellent reading for any sci-fi buff."
1698,4,"Overall: 4 3/4 StarsPlot/Storyline: 4 StarsThe plot was an original idea and fairly unique in its execution. This is a difficult book to review as far as plot and storyline as I don't want to give any spoilers.The book starts out with a few intriguing opening scenes that really made me want to keep reading. The storyline did progress pretty nicely, albeit at a slow pace, after those scenes. However, there were way too many extraneous scenes, sometimes entire chapters, that did not forward the storyline at all and just seemed to be added for speculation among the locals. There was plenty of speculating going on in the chapters that did forward the storyline without adding more.The exceptional storyline did make plodding through these extra chapters worth my time. I just had to discover what was going on with the new neighbors, the Aligers.My favorite parts of the story were the scenes where Perry Aliger gets confused with all of the English 'sayings.' These scenes really made me think about how often we say things without thinking of the literal meanings of the words.Character Development: 5 StarsMs. Darnell excels at character development. Her novel is peopled with truly unique individuals. Each character has depth and is completely different in both personality and circumstances from every other.There was a lot of imagination and thought put into each character. Ms. Darnell knows how to make the reader care about the characters and what happens to them.Perry was one of my favorite characters, mostly stemming from what I mentioned above regarding his confusing with English colloquialisms.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe writing style was superb. The book was filled with imaginative analogies and appropriate metephors. Ms. Darnell's command of the English language was evident in every sentence, without being overbearing. The sentence structure made for a nice, even flow to the reading experience. The descriptions were vivid, and the dialogue was like any conversation you would hear on the street or in your own house.Formatting/Editing: 4 3/4 StarsThere were some editing errors sprinkled throughout the novel, but none that would hinder the reading process.The formatting was of professional quality.Rating: PG for Adult Situations"
1699,5,"This is the third book of his that I have read and I really enjoy them. They have great plots and characters, but aren't  overly complicated. My husband and I have a second home in Rancho Mirage (which is in the Coachella Valley) and we go to Palm Springs a lot and it's fun to read about a place that I know so well. I love his attention to detail and descriptive way of writing that draws you into his books. I would definitely recommend his books and I already have!"
1700,5,What does one do when something is just not right? You are not the law. How does offering help to a runaway person change one's life?? Great story!!!!
1701,3,"Some of these are pretty good, but so many are equally cheesy.  Working in the IT world, some of them were scary in how well I could relate!"
1702,2,A little disappointed. I wanted to like the story and kept hoping the story would get better but it didn't. Lame
1703,5,I'd never read any of the Amy Brewster mysteries until this one..  So I am really hooked on them now.
1704,3,"Competently written standard fare as steamy adult romances go. Nothing that elevates it above Ms. Kennedy's other work, but certainly entertaining enough."
1705,5,"One wonders how these people survived what with the conditions and stress they lived with daily. Although their cause was not just, their bravado was admirable. Great book for manyone interested in history."
1706,4,"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to ""show"" him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much."
1707,5,This is one that t his at the heart love the main characters Neil was great and Sarah highly recommend
1708,5,"In todays changing family structure,  Seasons will keep you thinking of what is going on in the homes around you. Superbly well written. I didn't want to put it down. And as always with a Rebeca Forester, a refreshing twist in the last chapter."
1709,5,Maddie ends up with Seth...which completely breaks your heart. But there is a love story between an angel and neliphim which makes you miss Roman. As always Georgina kicks ass!
1710,5,"This book hit so close to home for me because I was the same way. 35+, plus-size who had concentrated on my kids and working and then when they were close to leaving the nest I sat back and took stock of what I had missed out on. My list was probably longer than Karon's. But my Tristan was oh so eager to marks things off!! He relished turning this Good Girl oh so BAD!!This was a really great read and you just fell in love with all the characters! I can't wait to see if Ms. Matthews has sequels for the other characters because they soooo deserve their own stories!! And the sex scenes were really HOT!! This is a book you won't put down until you have read it all the way through. Enjoy!!"
1711,5,"If your looking for adventure you will be dissapointed, aside from the Time Machine and War of the worlds the stories from H G Wells are more dedicated to love and relationships in which there are in excess of a dozen.Love is a complex subject matter as witnessed by our author, untill our final story the compexity of relationships is laid bare with complete understanding.I have read this works in conjunction with the works of Jules Verne which I also give 5 stars. To sum up for the reader: One is the master of understanding love and romance in the narrative the other is the master of adventure and imagination.Both books are amazing value, containing endless hours of enjoyment."
1712,5,"I had never read any of the old Classics so I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews.  It did start a little slow, but at the same time intriguing with the mystery of where the bullet came from.  At times I could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of the characters, and found it very interesting how they created things we take for granted today.  It's hard to remember that people used to have to do everything for themselves, it sure has been a lost art in the western society! I found the writing wonderful and Jules Verne painted wonderful details which made the story itself such a pleasure to read!"
1713,4,"Ty Johnston has created a character in Kron Darkbow that reminds me a little bit of The Punisher.  His family was killed and he is going to get revenge no matter what it takes.  When he finds the wizard responsible for the actual killings he finds out that the order came from another.  He switches his target immediately not caring that he is now taking on arguably the most powerful man in the city.As other reviewers have stated this book really does not leave you guessing at what is going to happen, but it does its job very well.  The scenery is described with enough detail that you know what the environment looks like, but it does not bog the story down.  Action is the number one thing in this book and there is plenty of it: chases, narrow escapes, assassins, sword fights, magic, torture, etc...The second book promises a much bigger bad guy to take down and a few new friends to help out.  I will be picking it up in the near future for sure."
1714,3,"I subscribe to both Analog Science Fiction and Fact and [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  My Kindle subscriptions, delivered via the Kindle app on my iPad, save me from myself.  Instead of hunting down magazines at the bookstore--or wondering where they disappeared to from the mail--I just wait for them to show up.  Nice, low-fuss delivery.  And then instant reading gratification.Analog has about half of the science fiction content of its competitor.  It makes up for this with more information from the ""Fact"" side of the fence.  The factual articles, editorials and letters to the editor are interesting and occasionally very interesting.  They wouldn't stand on their own, but are worth the subscription price when bundled with the fiction.My personal take:  I like reading on devices like the iPhone and iPad that also hold a lot of legitimate, technical information.  Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I think I'm getting away with it, but I do enjoy reading Analog and Asimov's in a long, boring, all-hands work meeting.The recommendation:  If you only subscribe to one Kindle magazine for science fiction, make it [Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine].  If you have the extra time, subscribe to this magazine as well.  It's a good complement with a real-science emphasis less present in Asimov's."
1715,4,"Doan is a private eye with questionable ethics - by his own account.  He is a short fat man who goes everywhere with his huge great dane Carstairs.  Doan is easily and often underestimated, although Carstairs is not.  Carstairs and Doan loathe each other, so this is is not the typical dog owner-pet novella.D & C end up in Mexico where Doan's mission is to dissuade an American city embezzler from returning to the States where he will rat on the other politicians.  A bus takes him to a small town with a cast of other tourists.  Once there, all heck breaks loose and Doan is in the middle.  The book is filled with good humor and amusing characters.  The plot is a good one with many of the supporting characters throwing in important contributions.  Some of the dialogue is priceless including the bus driver's exceptional broken English.This is decent mystery that will often bring a smile to the reader's lips as he is taken for a ride by the unassuming Doan and stately Carstairs."
1716,5,"I really loved this story.  It has a really different twist on the making of the Werewolf Species.  It contends that a virus was loosed on the human population and those who survived the virus became werewolves.The premise of Queen Nayla taking captive, Mace, the Alpha Were and having him as her sex slave was also different. Better than different the scenes were smoookin hot and numerous. Kept the heart racing and panties damp.Put me at the head of that line for a body slave that looks and acts like Mace.It was a great read and worth the price.  I highly recommend it.  Warning Lady's it will leaving you panting and needy."
1717,5,I love the works by Mark Twain because he was an interesting man.I visited his house in Hartford Conn. where he wrote many of his stories Love it!
1718,5,"Having read so many of Ms. Kennedy's SEAL series, I was thrilled and LUCKY to have found this for free. I absolutely adore her books, and this one did  not disappoint. You can always expect a wonderfully true-to-life set of characters, humor, and scorching love scenes. Looking forward to her newest release!"
1719,4,"An Arab youth finds an old jar in a cave in Jordan and in it is a scroll.  He takes it to Ramallah to his cousin to get it translated because it might have Kabbalist secrets and is questioned by an Israeli security service.  His body is found after being rammed by a car.Greg McKenzie,  retired OSI from the military, is hot headed and blurts out his opinions, which keeps him from advancement in the military and makes enemies for him with the Nashville Police Dept. when he worked there as a Detective for the D.A.'s office after retirement from the military.  Greg and his wife Jill visit Israel and the mid-east where a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase what appears to be an old scroll and she tucks it in her carryon.  After picking up their luggage at the airport on their return, they find the locks on the cases have been cut off and the luggage rifled.  Immediately after returning home, Jill suddenly disappears and Greg gets a phone call telling him they will exchange Jill for the scroll.  Greg takes it to two different professors who translate the scroll for him.  The story continues filled with murder, close escapes, car chases, a Palestinian radical group, an Israeli radical group and Jordan all after this scroll.  The story is  page turner, fascinating, fast moving and not very long.  It is an easy read and entertaining.  I recommend it."
1720,5,"From the beginning, things are hot. From double penetration to BSDM in every way imaginable, this book was sensual and sexy."
1721,5,"Well, this one was very nice. I expect that when anyone wins a large amount of money, you would become protective of who you meet. this story traverses 3 friends that have won the lottery and are trying to find love. very hot scenes and sweet loving! i like all three stories. I love to read series for some reason. It seems to keep the characters alive for me!"
1722,2,Really too short to even review.  Not sure what was up with the necklace.  Ended in a way.  Puzzled about all of the plot.  Product description longer than story...lol
1723,4,"I periodically buy a paper copy to enjoy over a cup of coffee.  The E-book edition is convenient whenever I have a few minutes to spare and no available coffee shop.  My only other comment; when buying a hard copy one day, the E-book edition the next day may include some duplicate stories."
1724,4,"Since I bought the sequel, I guess I enjoyed it. I found myself comparing it to Juster`s Phantom Tollboth and thinking Phantom  was better. But I found that I liked the Langman characters enough to care about them, and the plot interesting enough to wonder what happens next. Tollbooth may be a masterpiece, but so far Logic is a pretty fun read.  At this point I`d give Logic a 92 on a scale where Phantom Tollbooth was 100.  That`s pretty good; I`ll read the sequel next and review it to let y`all know if  made a mistake."
1725,4,"My Dad, God bless him, was an avid fan of Lovecraft and I refused to read it when I was younger because of a  nightmare I had after one of his short stories.  Now I enjoy reading them.  Some are a little too repetitive in that he reuses certain material.  At least one had virtually no ending.  Some are too predictable.  All are well written and pleasant to read, just a little dated.  I would have to say overall that I enjoy the stories in the book and would recommend it if you are tired of some of the more modern trends in writing.  With Lovecraft you have to have an imagination.  He counts on it and plays with it in order to achieve his goal of giving you the creeps.  He takes you just so far and then lets your mind do the rest.  This requires a certain talent both from the writer and the reader.  A nice collection of stories to keep your mind occupied when you need it."
1726,5,Starting from the mid to late 60's Andre Norton has been a favorite of mine.  Andrea L. Miller does have a point about the order of the stories or books in that I prefer to read a series in the correct order.  I did a quick search and got a complete list of Andre Norton's works.  I then compared it to the titles in the collection and found 3 series.  Here are the series and titles in order of their published date.Series:  Draw Rennie - Date Published and Title:  1961 -  Ride Proud Rebel!Series:  Draw Rennie - Date Published and Title: 1962  -  Rebel SpursSeries:  Ross Murdock/Time War - Date Published and Title: 1958  -  The Time TradersSeries:  Ross Murdock/Time War - Date Published and Title: 1962  -  The Defiant AgentsSeries:  Ross Murdock/Time War - Date Published and Title: 1963  -  Key Out of TimeSeries:  Solar Queen - Date Published and Title: 1956  -  Plague ShipSeries:  Solar Queen - Date Published and Title: 1959  -  Voodoo Planet
1727,5,"I really enjoyed this story.  I found it hard to put my kindle down once I started reading about Max and Anna.  He lied to her for a good reason, he thought, but he almost lost her because of it. Aunt Abigail was really a shrewd lady and she had her nephew all figured out.  You must read this and form your own opinions from this story.  I loved it and will be waiting for the next great story from Raeanne Thayne.  It has got to be another great read."
1728,4,There is plenty of action and some interesting characters. I will probably read more of this author.  The love story is also realistic which shows good writing for this short a story.
1729,5,"Vic Bayne is a PsyCop. A Level 5 medium, he can easily hear the dead, and often see them. Psychics are now licensed, and some have gone through training to join police departments where they're teamed up with a non-psychic to solve crimes. Vic's partner (Maurice) for the last 12 years has just retired, his new partner and friend, Lisa, was discovered to have psychic talents she never reported and was subsequently put on suspension, fellow cop Jacob Marks initiated a romantic relationship with Vic, and a string of perplexing murders is beginning to unfold. It's no wonder Vic downs anti-psychic drugs like they were tic-tacs. With all of this going on, he really doesn't need to hear the dead incessantly babbling to him about how they died.The story is told from first-person perspective and maintains a comfortable conversational tone. Vic is a fairly complex character filled with flaws. He abuses the drugs that deaden his ability (the fact they give a good buzz is icing on his cake), he's rather jaded (seeing dead people all the time will do that to you) and pessimistic, but surprisingly flexible and accepting. Small changes are evident in Vic through the course of the story as he grows romantically involved with Jacob (there are a few detailed and erotic scenes in the book, but they're not excessive in quantity). Most good novels have the characters go through a change within the pages. In serial novels (there's a series of PsyCop stories), these changes are slower since there will be many more stories following. It's subtle, but noticeable, that Vic is moved by his relationship with Jacob, and there's an impression that this is one of the first times Vic is opening himself up to committing to someone else. Vic is examined deeply in the book, but secondary characters are also given care and come off as unique individuals. While the motivation of some individuals isn't apparent in this book (like why Jacob aggressively flirts with Vic), it's only the first book in the series. Questions raised in this book are answered later in the series, which adds a great deal of depth to the characters and stories. After all, in real life, we don't always know people's motivations until later.This story is VERY enjoyable. It goes a bit beyond mere psychic abilities and enters into much deeper supernatural realms, covering the possibilities of evil entities and other creatures of the night. A serial killer has killed twice, but left no marks on the victims other than a placing a broken piece of mirror underneath the victims' eyelids. To make matters worse, eyewitness descriptions of the person accompanying the victim all vary, as if it were a different person each time.The ending is incredibly touching even when you see it coming. All in all, it's a very interesting and entertaining sexy thriller that is easily enjoyed."
1730,5,Love to read the old classics and i will be reading this one many more times later on like all of the other books
1731,5,What can I say ladies. Find yourself a peaceful spot and enjoy. Let's just say my husband benefited from this book!
1732,5,"This novel was so emotionally moving my heart literally ached. I loved medieval stories that are well told. And this one has a fantasy twist that makes it that much more fun. Reading about knights and castles are always enjoyable novels for me. Bottom line...Woman of Honor is a well-told, emotionally gripping story. I was literally swept away into the battle scenes, the romance, the fierce loyalty and honor even if it went against matters of the heart. I nearly cried several times while reading this story and was so engrossed a bomb could have gone off outside and I would've kept reading. I am eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. And anyone who has a computer can read this book. While it may not be a print book yet and can only be read in e-book format, it's well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. My heart is still pounding. And don't let that sweet rating fool you. There was some serious passion in this novel, but if you were to compare it to most romances I guess it was sweet since the characters honored each other's purity. But it still sizzled. And talk about an ending that leaves you begging for more. Sheesh! But it was more than satisfying. I'm just glad that April is only a few months away."
1733,5,"I loved this novella/short story.  I got ""Dead Man's Rain"" first for free when it was offered for the Kindle, but I went to Frank Tuttle's website because I wanted to read his works in this series in order.  I got the sample and loved it and since it was only 2 dollars, I couldn't resist it.  Anyone who wants a slightly silly and fun trip through a world where mythological and fantasy creatures really exist alongside people, should read this bok because this is the book for you.  I would say it's even ok for children, at least this one, because there's nothing hugely graphic spelled out except for mention of blood and people getting hit.  I will start Dead Man's Rain shortly."
1734,5,"I completely  Love the way Paisley Smith takes you through this story. She is so good at erotic love stories. I want to read them all. The characters are completely believable.  The sex is so hot you might want to keep this one by your bed.  I completely sank myself in this story. She created such a  erotic  story line I could not stop reading. When I had to, I could not wait to get back to Annie and Emily.  I will read this one many , many times!!!  Get it you will love it. I did!!"
1735,5,"""Trust Me"" by Astrid AmaraBrian Day's life has finally settled into a routine he loves, for the most part.  He lives with his partner Jay Yervant, being perfect complements to each other's powers.  However, Brian's powers have been getting a little out of control lately, leading to problems with Jay, his role as a Hell Cop, and life in general.  And now to top it all off, someone is framing Brian for a series of gruesome murders.""Trust Me"" is a great follow up story about Jay and Brian and how unpredictable life can be when one deals with demons, sorcerous powers, and vengeful parents.  I loved this highly emotional story set in the intriguing Parmas City.""Dark Waters"" by Nicole KimberlingMichael Gold is a professor and strong proponent of peace between demon races and humans.  So he sets out on a ""field trip"" to observe a native ceremony of the Faun community.  However, bringing his current lover Detective Dion Argent might not have been the best move, especially as Michael isn't quite sure how Argent feels about him.  When trouble begins to brew, Michael might just change his mind about that and forget all his reservations about Argent being a Hell Cop.In ""Dark Waters"" we catch up with the unlikely pair made up by Michael and Argent and they are as hot as ever.  Once again, Parmas City provides a great backdrop for a sorcery, murder, and mayhem mixed in with a hot romance!""Such Heights"" by Ginn HaleJames Sparks is tired of his current lover Detective Ben Moran constantly being on his case about the risks he takes while doing his job as an investigative reporter.  It's not like James is clueless or reckless, but if Ben had his way James would hardly do more than fluff reporting.  To demonstrate his good sense James takes a fairly high profile, low risk job of documenting life on striking Storm Palace.  But just as always, trouble finds James, this time in the form of a murder and trapping him far away from any contact with the outside world, especially Ben.""Such Heights"" is a story full of intrigue, romance, and acceptance.  James and Ben make for such contrasts that they make perfect foils for each other.  Don't pass up this story!Hell Cop 2 is a great collection of follow-up stories that began in the initial Hell Cop anthology.  All three stories are hotter than hot, fast-paced, action packed which will keep you glued to the pages and riveted well past your bed time.  Don't pass up the chance to pick up this awesome collection of stories by some great authors - Hell Cop 2 is well worth the lost sleep!SabellaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1736,3,"Lovers and roommates Christian and Joel want a cleaner for their home and if she's sexy, well then all the better. After they interview several horrid candidates they open the door to a young woman who'd fallen off her bicycle before showing up for her interview. Just one look at her and both men fall for the innocent girl and are determined to make her theirs.  Soon, Susie's cooked and cleaned her way into their hearts and what starts as merely some sensual fun turns into a desire for something much more.Susie's Choice was an interesting read. One thing's for sure, it was definitely a scorching hot read. But I just couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters. Susie's father treated her deplorably and she really didn't say anything in her defense. Even her brothers took her for granted, all demanding she cook and clean for them, having no life of her own.Christian's constant telling Joel he loved him, with no response in return was disheartening and almost seemed desperate. Joel's cowardice in not telling Christian he loved him went beyond his fear of being hurt. It smacked almost of manipulation, which lowered his stature in my eyes.While the sex between the two men as well as the three of them was undeniably hot, it seemed there were more pages of sex than there were of plot.  It got to the point that I really felt I knew nothing about the characters and wasn't sure if I wanted to. If you're interested in a story filled with almost nothing but sex and a token Happily Ever After, Susie's Choice might be something you'd be interested in reading. If, however, you want a story with any sort of character development and emotional depth, you might want to give this one a pass.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews."
1737,4,"E.E. Smith well deserves his reputation. I di not know he liked the ladies so much. However much these stories caught the readers attention when first published, much of the &#34;Gee Whiz&#34; is very dated."
1738,5,"Loved the characters in this book, and this was a great mystery, one I could not put down. Henry solves the mystery and this one has a twist."
1739,4,"Lived the characters went well together great story, wish there was more background and well more, it was a little short for me but I realise it was ment to be what I wouldn't give to have more with these characters. Like maybe their future lives together or something. Hot hot hot!"
1740,5,Follow the intense legal maneuvers of Alex Sedaka and his employees as they try to beat the clock for an inmate scheduled to be executed at midnight.  This book will keep you going.  The chapters are a timeline of what is happening so you know how close it is to midnight as you go.  I did figure out a few things before they were revealed but it still kept me turning pages.  A very intense book that will hold your attentions.

1742,1,"Sex Idol Shelley Munro.ARC provided via Netgalley.With all the reality shows that currently dominate TV ( and they're the reason I spend so much time reading and don't watch TV) I thought this sounded fun. I get the impression from many of the current programmes that what they really want is to push the sex angle as far as they can without getting banned or reprimanded, so this seemed like something possible at some time in the future. Though I think current TV is dire, this would really kill it for may of us who want programmes designed for those who think and use imagination and don't need to be spoon fed :)Still, the book. Well, as I said I thought this would be fun. A bit of sexy, spicy, erotica wrapped up in an interesting story. Sadly I was wrong, and what this consists of in my opinion is simply page after page after page of sex, self pleasure, with a partner or with multiple partners, with a flimsy, feeble story as an excuse for carrying it. The plot is thin, really poorly put together, (for instance landlords of commercial properties don't call round for a cheque days after a rent rise...it's all BACS transactions..) with the sex part being so repetitive its actually a turn off. I ended up skim reading pages just to see what happened, and get to the end. It certainly wasn't erotic for me :( Its sad really because I think its a novel idea, and could have been really fun and erotic if done in a different way.If you really like this sort of thing you'll find the price of 1.01 for 230 pages/369kb a bargain but for me...no - quickly deleted from my kindle.Stars: sorry but just one."
1743,4,"Wow, how much can you really say about a three chapter story.  I thought both characters were great, and a full fledge book could have been written about either one.  The concept of facing two serial killers, both who prey on unsuspecting hitchhikers, against each other is brilliant.  I would have loved to read more about each of their prior victims, what made them become serial killers, what are the authorities doing about them.  You just know that this story line would support the grizzled old veteran homicide detective trying to catch them.  I really enjoyed the concept of the story, but wish it would have been more.  Horror fans will enjoy Serial, and I recommend it to anyone that likes good characters, interesting plot...oh yea, and blood and guts!"
1744,5,"If you like westerns, you'll love this book. Great story with great characters. This book is well worth reading! Go ahead and try it!"
1745,4,"Great characters, good plot, very engaging. It's not literary fiction, but it's perfect summer escapism, and fun to read about the world of high fashion."
1746,5,Loved this book and all the charactersThe story flowed perfectly from scene to sceneMake it into a movie
1747,5,"If you love capture erotica or erotic romance, coercion and that whole sex slave theme, I think you'll enjoy this story. I did. I thought it was very hot, but then I'm a big fan of those themes, actively searching out those books that give me this un-PC take on sex, domination, and submission. I know not everyone likes this power dynamic, where a woman is completely at the mercy of a man, but I really love it. So I tend to forgive or to overlook flaws in such a story, especially if the story gives me kidnapping, captive/sex slave, and some hot bdsm action all at the same time, which this story does.This is a story about Lynne, newly divorced and ready to start a new phase of her life, who ends up getting lost in the Appalachians. It's dark and snowy out, with the terrain growing more steep and remote, and not another person in sight. Just when she decides to turn her SUV around and backtrack, she catches a glimpse of movement. Not quite sure what it is, and with her nerves on edge, she guns her car, only then to see a man in the road. She swerves to miss him and slides in the ice and snow off the road and into a tree. From the impact, she passes out and wakes up five days later in a small cabin, all alone with a man who just broke out of prison.Jesse is huge, tattooed, scarred, and muscled, and he does look like a scary convict, very big, dangerous, and hard looking. Lynne recognizes him from TV and knows that he is a convicted rapist and murderer. She immediately thinks the same fate awaits her and that her only hope is to give him what he must want, sex, and to keep him wanting her around until she has a chance to run away from him.Despite his fearsome reputation and all he's been accused of doing, you know Jesse is going to be more than that. He takes care of Lynne, nursing her back to health. 'It was the first time another person had ever depended upon him for everything- from feeding them, to dressing their wounds, to bathing them.' He doesn't want Lynne to be afraid of him; he wants her to believe in him and his story.But for all of this, his good intentions, he is still a bad boy who has been without a woman for seven years. Knowing what he has been convicted of doing, Lynne desperately wants to please Jesse, to satisfy him, and to keep him happy, and Jesse is unable to turn down her sweet compliance and submission. It calls to everything dark in him. This is his kink: a woman eager to please, a woman naked save for only a dog collar and chain, a woman bound and submitting to his complete sexual dominance.The story is short, only around 900 locations, but, given that, it still manages to do a lot for me. For what it was, this story gave me exactly what I love. I thought Jesse was a total turn-on. He is the archetype of the sexy, dominating alpha male, all tough but vulnerable, flawed but perfect in so many ways. I loved him.This story is so very HOT, but only if you like these sorts of themes. This story doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It was some damn good captive erotica/ER. And unlike other stories with the same themes, this story does not have any hard bdsm elements. There is no discipline, punishment, pain or humiliation. There is only a very sexy and dominant male with a bondage fetish and a real thing for a submissive woman who asks, 'Should I go to the bed or to my knees?'"
1748,4,"Very short read. Would've like to have had more plot to the story, and more time to spend with the characters."
1749,5,"This was a great series...I couldn't put it down.  Each of the men and their stories were captivating.  Makes me want to check out Bear Creek, Alaska.  On a side note, I believe the books as they fall in the bundle are not in order...so you may want to check out the author's website to make sure you read them in order."
1750,5,This was a great book & I enjoyed the 2nd book also. Too bad Cooper Davis doesn't have more books.
1751,3,"I read the first part of this trilogy,Seducing Jane Porter, because if I got it free on Kindle.  Then I was curious to see how the rest of the weekend went.  After the night with Antonio, he introduces her to his long-time friend Santos.  This book is about the 3 of them and the warning in the product description is on target --- ""Warning: This book contains copious amounts of champagne, kinky under-the-table hi-jinks, a menage to die for, voyeurism and angry shower sex.""  Jane's best friend, Lilly, is having her own fun - this is a subplot but it could be a stand alone story - if it had just a tad bit more attention.  Note before Purchase: this is also a very short story, about 40 pages.  I have also read the third installment,Reinventing Jane Porter: Jane Porter Series, Book 3."
1752,4,Totally enjoyed this book...well written and fast paced.....easy read.  Am looking forward to the next one......thought it was a good take on the traditional vampire story.
1753,4,"While it is a shorter book it's much longer then other short stories I've read, thankfully. This has a really cool concept and isn't disappointing at all. Despite Nissa and Hex being the main characters I think I liked Aleron more then them. Anyway I thought it was good and worth time to read, plus it's free and so far one of the best free erotic novels I've read."
1754,5,It cracks me up how serious the British take themselves.  19th century racism is funny too.  I look forward to reading the other books in the series.
1755,3,"Very sad situation makes you wonder about all the children out there that still have no hope!We should all be aware of child abuse even in the most affluent family's ,always help a child in needThere helpless to protect there selves.JoNaples Fl"
1756,3,"I enjoyed this book. I can't say that about all books I read. Yes, it was a little juvenile, but it is a book about kids. I do wish that there had been a bit more detailed scenarios involving what was actually in the fog, or maybe some action sequences involving whatever inhabits the fog. All in all, it was definitely a good buy, I read the whole thing, and would recommend this to PA fans, and teens."
1757,4,"MadnessLet me start off by getting the bad news out of the way, telling you what issues I had with Madness, by Sorcha MacMurrough:Sweet Lord, the spelling errors!  I am more than willing to forgive an error or two in a good book.  It can even be fun to spot them, it makes you feel clever and perceptive.  Not so in Madness, there were so many, many errors that it became more of a challenge to try to ignore them!  I was seriously disappointed by this because it knocked what could have been a great book down to just a good book, if your willing to overlook the mistakes.Editors, help!  There were a few charactors whom could have done with more development, less repetition.  Along the same lines, I felt like the book could have lost a few chapters, sped things along and been made better for it.  Also, I have to say that I wish addiction and mental illness could be addressed in reality as simply as it is in this book.  Not that this aspect was handled badly, just that it contradicts conventional understanding of both topics.  Its simplified, I guess I would say.  My final complaint is the ending... without giving anything away, I will say that there are some remarkable coincidences and unimaginable good luck.  Something more practical may have been better.Now, all of that being said, I did enjoy this book.  I can honestly say that this book is very different from other romance novels I've read.  For one thing, the main female character, Gabrielle, is the hero of the story.  She literally and figuratively rescues her man, Simon.  Gabrielle is a strong, determined, hard working woman who knows her own mind.  She is not afraid to do what she has to in order to protect the people she loves.  She isn't afraid to go against conventional society norms and make choices and decisions that are right for her, what will make her happy.  Gabrielle was resourceful and stubborn in an endearing way.  She was the kind of character that you wanted to see happy at the end of the story.As for the Hero of the book, Simon... What can I say?  Simon is the kind of man every girl wants to find and keep forever.  Simon is smart, strong, handsome, loyal but with horrors in his past and demons that only his Lady Love can help him overcome.  Simon was passionate, sweet, thoughtful, brave and absolutely devoted to his Lady.  He has an insatiable love and lust for Gabrielle and he is determined to fight to transform himself into the kind of man who is worthy of her love.  One thing that I really appreciated about this story is the fact that Simon's intelligence was celebrated instead of down played or perceived as a weakness.  He's a hot hunk of man, but with a brain and a huge heart.While the physical relationship between Gabrielle and Simon doesn't begin immediately, once it begins... its on!  There was A LOT of sex in this story.  Tastefully done but abundant. The plus side to this, perhaps, is that the love that Gabrielle and Simon feel for one another is obvious and sweet, which for me made the banquet of sex less pointless or tedious.I would recommend this book to friends, with the aforementioned caution on the spelling and grammar errors.  If the small issues I mentioned were fixed, I would have given this book 5 stars.  The characters and the love they shared was solid gold, the story was interesting and manages to draw you into the dark corners that these characters visit, then usher you back to the light with the love they discover with one another.  Madness was worth the read, good enough that I'm not going to include a pun based on the title in my review."
1758,4,"lose the war,lose your boat lose your girl(maybe).kind of an insight into the mentality of &#34;upper class germans&#34; & their take on things"
1759,5,"Ok, so I'm always starting some of these series books in the wrong order. I read this first when it is the 2nd of a 2 book series it seems. I will be reading ""THE TAMING OF ELIZA JANE"" next for sure!The moment Rebecca steps off that stage and Adam is there to greet her, you immediately feel the web of attraction between them. (that's how good Shannon's writing is).......The biting words shared are all part of an elaborate dance that we the reader can feel, won't last for long. Rebecca is determined to let her hair down (so to speak) and cut loose in this wild west town ( held in check by a Sheriff *ADAM*that has somewhat of a reputation of shoot first ask questions later)...HIs deputy Will is newly married to Eliza Jane and is constantly running off to be with her so Adam figures it's time for him to maybe take a nice sweet wife like Rebeccca.  Boy is he in for a surprise when she starts dressing in the clothes her aunt left her along with the ""house of ill repute""....Yes, she is now not only a madam, but a virginal one at that! Dare she ask Adam to be her first??...........Of  course Adam doesn't like her revealing clothes or the face paint-especially not the looks she gets from the men! When she asks everyone to call her Miss Becky he about comes unglued. Well, it seems our 'Miss Becky"" has a good reason to be incognito,(the suspense) and between the bible brigade, Eliza's liberated women and Adam's bumbling courtship, oh, and Will's bubble baths with his wife........this story actually has a lot of story(if you know what I mean) I was never bored and the laughs, tears and oohs and ahhhs made this a very enjoyable book for me. The romance rates high in this one....and the sex is sweet, never overdone nor smutty. Yes, the 'other side' of this dangerous sheriff .........is......""sigh""......and tha't's sooo sexy.Great Job! Gotta read the first one now..........."
1760,2,"The book started out ok, but it got monotonous after awhile.  I got really tired of all the bird references about flying straight, etc and then all the honor this and dishonor that.  I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. I won't go for a second."
1761,4,"This novel had me stumped as I love the author, her style, vivid descriptions and handling of sex scenes which are hot and spicy.  I didn't quite know however what to make of this frighteningly clever play on history, or what we know as history.  I can't say I didn't like it because there is so much right with it and yet I didn't love it as I usually do with this author.  The whole Jesus concept with the twins and Abbie who is caught up in this by a freak of nature is enthralling, almost compelling so if you enjoy books by Heather then read it and see what you think. One thing is certain however and that is the fact that this is a clever book by a clever writer."
1762,5,"short sweet and gets to the point quickly, he is funny in his writing as well as his talks, he is a good speaker and the book is an easy read because he makes it interesting like his talks."
1763,5,"Lily and the Sheriff. Just what is going on?. Hard life for a woman, certainly gets you thinking - What is the temptation?"
1764,2,It could have been so much better. It seemed thrown together. To have started with such a fantastic idea the story consisted of nothing but gore and predictability. It would be stretching it to call this the very bare skeleton of a great book. The whole thing was much too rushed and unbelievable.
1765,4,"This collection of H. Beam Piper is a very good representation of the man's work. My only complaints are 1) The monospace type is a bit distracting, and 2) I have to echo another reviewer in that it is difficult to navigate around books already read because there is no index that will allow you to go quickly to selected pieces. But heck, for the price, I guess it's worth it. Second hand book sellers are asking three times Amazon's price for just ""Junkyard Planet"" or retitled as ""The Cosmic Computer"". I recommend Piper as a nice easy read that is not real heavy on the science and more on characters."
1766,4,"I found this book hard to really get into till about midway. I enjoyed the budding relationships between all the characters evolved. Just when you want to see if the romance happens the book ends. So because this has a part two out there, I am ready to check it out."
1767,5,"This book catches you in the beginning by engaging the characters from the start.  Keeps you turning the pages for more!  And, at the end, you find out what ALL the characters did.  Wraps it up so you finish with a smile!"
1768,4,"The story is nice, maybe a little too short, only 52 pages.It's a revisiting of The Wizard of Oz story, with Dorothy who here is named Kansas (like the United State) and it's not from Kansas, but from Iowa. Kansas is a independent wealthy man who decided to live like an hermit in his family land. When he is swept away from a tornado, no one notices his absence, and so Kansas is free to enjoy is adventure.He awakes in a strange world, inhabited by half-man half-beast being; the first two he meets are a cat like man and a bird like woman, a strange couple indeed. When the two find this strange being with bare skin and blue eyes, they think that it would be a nice gift for their king and decide to bring Kansas to him, even if the cat-like man would like to have a taste. In this world sensuality is the normal behavior and sex is almost a recreational activity; Kansas will discover that even a simple bath in a pond has sexual consequences, and not thanks to another being, but since the waters are alive.When Kansas arrives to the king's palace, the first human-like man he meets is Z, a wizard. He is almost ""normal"" if not for the fact that he is extremely handsome and gold colored. Z. tells Kansas that, if he wants to have the chance to go back to home, he should refuse the king... and here maybe The Wizard of Oz mixed with One Thousand and One Nights. And here maybe is where I'd like the story to be a bit longer: there is an acceleration that brings the reader to the end of the story when it would be interesting to have more; the relationship between the King and Kansas is only hinted, and almost chaste in comparison to all the other sexual experiences Kansas had before ""consorting"" with the King.Naughty thought on the title: Not in Kansas means that the story is not setting in Kansas like The Wizard of Oz, or that the King is not allowed to ""enter"" Kansas (and I don't mean the State...)Anyway as I said the story is nice and enjoyable, more funny than serious; this is not the classical fantasy tale heavy in details, but it's more a funny escapade in a world that maybe is the dream world in Kansas' mind."
1769,5,"The story is interesting from a historical perspective as well as Bing a sweet, innocent Christian romance. I enjoyed reading it."
1770,4,talk about lucky.nothing like having a screwed up life as a kid.but when your lucky enough to find two men who know about it and are smart enough to be able to  give you exactly what  it takes to heal you. is the greatest gift.loved it
1771,5,The seamless weaving of fantasy into the ordinary kept this story both quietly interesting and always moving along without seeming to be jerky and/or forced to come to a desired conclusion.
1772,4,"all the Heat books were enjoyable... but this hero was the best. love her strong fiesty heroines, too!"
1773,5,I hate to sound like I'm repeating myself but this was an excellent book and great story.  I find that I've enjoyed all of Elizabeth's books and waiting for the next.  I would highly recommend this book.
1774,2,"I felt like this author was in a race against time to finish this book . I was disappointed by the shortness of it .Woman gets thrown overboard ,gets rescued by seal man , has sex in front of everybody for binding ceremony and then off to make evil stepmother and stepsister pay , THE END ! (duh) If more thought had gone onto it ,I hope it could have been better . Now I'm iffy about this author ."
1775,3,"There is nothing original in this very short Regency M/M romance.The setting is the usual one, gay aristocrats having to cope with the homophobic, claustrophobic mores of a time and society when laws founded on religious beliefs used to fetter people's life.To this well trodden setting the author adds the usual topic of forced proximity as the two lovers are bound to remain in the same place for a given numer of days and have no way to avoid each other, again a very common choice in this kind of novels.There is one twist though: the two star-crossed lovers have not only already met (this would be common) but they have been lovers in their early youth, until they were separated when one of them, a second son and therefore kind of useless to his father, was sent to war to acquire a status for himself. Problem is that, after five years, he had to come back because (second twist) he has lost his left forearm. Haunted by honour, duty and guilt Ian (the come-back soldier) has to be seduced again because he seems to consider the previous affair with Nicky a juvenile mistake and the attraction he still feels for Nicky something to be repressed.I will not spoil the third twist (a bit contrived) that allows them their happily ever after.All in all the story was captivating. The two main characters are easy to love even if the soldier sounds more childish, at times, than guilt-ridden and the other lover seems a little too unsouciant.The story could surely have born more fleshing out: it takes place within a limited time scope (twelve days) but it needs not have taken twelve pages to be told. There are several moments that feel hurried and character building could have been better.More care should have also been given to the sex scenes: they are emotional because of the baggage the two carry with them but they are not very erotic."
1776,5,"I cannot imagine someone growing up under the circumstances that Marianne did without becoming so embittered that normal life wasn't possible. I finished this book in two days, I couldn't put it down. I would love to see a toned down version of this book in 5th grade reading classes. How do you teach young children the warning signs other than if it doesn't feel right tell someone. I felt her loneliness and despair."
1777,4,I enjoyed the story and thought it was well done.  While like the other reviewer I didn't care for the foursome the rest of the book was done well.  It didn't fit into Rachel's character in the book who was so hurt and cautious.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series but not if there are more secenes that seem completely out of place or character.

But Hope's mother, has forced his hand. She wants her creation back, and she wants any children he may breed with her daughter. His unique genetic makeup has created a male unlike any other and Hope is the one woman destined to be mate.

The introduction of the Alpha and Lupina of the Wolf Breeds. The Feline's have Sanctuary and the Wolves are building Haven. The premise of the story line sets a new slant on shape shifters. If you enjoy the genre you will find this book a good start in the series. The author notes on her website that the series was published over a few publishing houses and the series sequencing is hard to catch because titles are not set in true order and the mix between the different breeds makes for confusion in reading the titles. The sequencing on her website and the book descriptions are sketchy or incorrect. However, if you want a summer series to read, this is a good light read.7 out of 10 Bookends"
1779,5,"I usually gravitate towards more suspenseful material, but this &#34;Serial Fiction&#34; is quite satisfying. I LOVED the descriptiveness of the setting, living not too far from Denver, the author really put you right there! It actually inspired me to take a mini vacation to Denver! I'm a happy ending kind of girl, but there are a few situations where the ending is overly perfect. But who doesn't want that perfect ending in real life? I'd never heard of Serial Fiction (writing & publishing a chapter a day), but I like it! What a wonderful way to connect with your audience!"
1780,5,"Hunter and Jericho share a cabin high in the Rocky Mountains where they live between assignments.  United by their love for one woman and determined to carry on her cause the men are at a point in their lives where they're ready to make some changes - after all they can't bring back Rebeccah by killing themselves supporting her cause.  Neither would have guessed that they'd find a new reason to make their Rocky Mountain cabin a home courtesy of a beautiful creature who captures their attention.Kaya, a cougar shifter, has lived with very little human interaction but something draws her to Hunter and Jericho's cabin.

What's she doing there wearing only Jericho's discarded shirt?  From her reaction to being discovered inhaling food it's obvious she's terrified and that only increases their curiosity about her.

And what happens when Hunter and Jericho get called out on an assignment and must leave Kaya behind?Maya Banks delivers yet another captivatingly emotional read that promises to stay in your memory long after you've finished reading the final page of AMBER EYES.  Hunter, Jericho and Kaya have deep-seated fears and issues which have dictated how they handle situations.  Trust doesn't come easy for any of them but with a lot of patience, understanding and love they all have the possibility of finding happiness together.  AMBER EYES is one of those stories that draws the reader into the plot, allows you to fall in love with the characters and warms your heart with each new revelation.  I smiled, worried, laughed, agonized and cried along with the characters and wanted nothing more than for them to all have a happily-ever-after. Ms. Banks has a `mystical' spin on shifters that really captures my interest and definitely has me eager to pick up any and all future books she writes.AMBER EYES is the sequel to GOLDEN EYES, which was released through another publisher so be sure to stop by Ms. Banks' website to discover the `rest of the story' or at least the rest of it so far.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
1781,4,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background, I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
1782,4,Wow hot sex and great story line. Was so happy that the sister ended up alright and Eva ended up being wanted and loved
1783,4,"This short novella was in deed, a very H-O-T read! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting. Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner. Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot, scorching sex & plenty of them too ;) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany's barriers. They are opposites, yet they are perfect for one another. This was definitely a super sexy read. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a hot erotica. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
1784,5,"brilliant! i loved this book, ive actually read this entire series and like all the rest of marie harte's books i adore it, id highly recommend her books to anybody"
1785,5,"This is a shorter story about a girl that starts out in a platonic relationship with two men she eventually ends up with. The author provides the perfect balance of strong protective male with hot sexual story line. The pacing is superb with some controversy sprinkled in for interest. It's unusual to find an erotica story that so perfectly balances romance and hot erotic scenes and this one fits the bill. If you want your erotica with a touch of romance, this is the one.4.5 stars!"
1786,5,"Although the story was relatively short, Ms Malone was able to give depth to the characters so that I understood their feelings, and the depth of sexual tension between Mya and Milo. I can't wait to read more about the agency!"
1787,2,The story line just drug on and on. I did not like this book very much and if you are a mystery fan I would not tell you it is worth reading.
1788,4,This book was different than I expected but I did get caught up in it. I would recommend and I would read other books by this author.
1789,5,"I have to say that this book came to my attention by sheer luck, but I am really glad that it did. With deft skill and an aim to provide solid information and advice, Ed Benjamin puts focus on the Obama spending plan and just how to cash in on this lucrative opportunity. The author provides a solid base of informative on the plan, it's benefits to the public (from individuals to businesses) and then proceeds to outline the ways in which to get government contracts with an eye for detail and an easy to understand action plan.This is a smart, practical and highly informative guide that makes it possible to not only bulk up your business' profit margins, but to also make smart choices that can improve the longevity of your business and life goals. Mr. Benjamin really goes the distance in ensuring that the reader learns all they need to know about how to get ahead with the help of the Obama spending plan. This was well worth the read and left me with a wealth of knowledge about how to &#34;cash in&#34; on this lucrative opportunity."
1790,4,"4 and 1/2 stars! A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney is captivating, somewhat sad, yet sweet in its ugly duckling theme. Louisa believes herself to be ugly, not just unattractive, but actually ugly. She hears the snickers when she enters a room, the horrible insults launched at her back as she passes by, and knows that no man truly wants her for anything more than her extensive dowry. When she encounters the dark stranger who lives in a cave, keeps to the shadows but whose soothing voice and demeanor intrigues, and attracts her, she soon learns that there is more to a person than what is reflected in the mirror, or in others' eyes. Douglas fears that trying to live in the world alongside those who are so different from him endangers all who cross his path. Soon he learns that whereas normal is a concept which all humans strive to obtain, no one is truly normal and he may be accepted for his differences more easily than he expects.This dark, sweet novella about love overcoming diversity and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder will keep you enthralled from the beginning moments, when Louisa discovers the cave home of Douglas to the reveal of his dark secret, a lovely dance in the moonlight, and their eventual happily-ever-after. I highly recommend reading A DANCE IN THE DARK by Karen Ranney for any number of reasons listed above, but mostly because it's just that good - in fact, I wish it had been longer.***Copy gifted as part of subscribing to author's newsletter. My review is honest and unscripted, and was not requested by author."
1791,5,"As other reviewer have done a great job of summarizing the book, I won't repeat the summary here. I was nervous about purchasing the book based on the idea that it was 3 short stories. It's not that price was an issue - the author set a very low price which more than compensated for the length of the book. I was just a little leery because of the basic limitation in shorter works. In a short story, the author has very little time & space to set up the characters. In a fantasy setting, where the author has to set up a world for the characters and then set up the characters, short fiction is even harder and it takes a lot of talent for an author to overcome this. I thought Ms. Schneider did a great job. The world-building was a little sketchy but the characters and the story content more than compensated.My only complaint is that I'd really like to see more stories, or better yet a novel, set in this world. While there weren't any loose ends in the stories themselves, there are endless possibilities."
1792,5,Part of the WindVerse Series and a definite must read.  The plot and world in which these novels take place is very exciting and leaves the reader anxious for the next book in the series.
1793,3,"It wasn't bad, and the price was attractive.  &#34;Lost&#34; is accurate, but &#34;masterpieces&#34; is a gross overstatement.Analysis:  It's not bad if you need something to read on a plane, but there is far better stuff out there in the same price range."
1794,1,"I couldn't make it past chapter 2.  I dislike giving 1 star reviews and I am the first to admit that I may be more picky that most, and I don't want to take away from the author's hard work by tearing her book apart, but I do feel I should explain why I stopped reading after chapter 2.Through most of the first chapter it was hard to tell if the writer was writing in first person or third person.  I love fantasy, paranormal, and science fiction...a lot! But, chains that pop out of your body to tell who your life mate is, well, seems beyond weird and a little gross.  But the clencher was the sex scene in chapter 2.  It was rape.  She said no, period.  I have a hard time with ""erotica"" that passes off rape as sensual and enjoyable.So, there you have it.  Maybe it gets better after chapter 2, I don't know."
1795,2,I didnt like this book too much. The sexual content was mostly about having a threesome which i didnt find romantic at all. The author has other books that are way better.
1796,4,It was fun to read this book and how it kept me guessing until the end. Enjoyed the plot and how it kept me guessing on til the end. Good reading
1797,3,"I love the idea of this book, but it just never came together .  Lot's of drama and bed jumping, a little too much for me.."
1798,4,"Sera was finally back home in New Hampshire after a long two-year absence to face her demons.  Her psychic abilities were what led to the sabbatical in Arizona, but it was her emotional psychic connection to Jake Candellori that caused the ultimate humiliation, and need to flee.  Sera thought they had something special, but when her barriers were down when they made love, and her emotions overflowed, Jake had literally bolted.  She needed the time to learn to control her psychic senses, so she never had a repeat of her experience with Jake.Jake hated spring snowstorms, but he hated them even worse when his suv rolled after hitting a deer.  The snow was coming down, and he knew he needed to find shelter from this storm.  After walking for a half hour, he spotted lights from a house in the distance.  He made it to the door, and practically fell in when the door opened.  When Jake regained consciousness, he found himself plastered next to an almost naked Sera.  He hadn't realized she was back, and had exhausted all his contacts trying to look for her unable to stop thinking about her since she left.  He knew how badly he had treated her, but she had obviously decided to permanently close him out talking about inane things that didn't matter.  Jake was determined to get her back in his life, and would do whatever it took to make it happen.Sera and Jake had chemistry and a connection.  Jake's willingness to read up on psychics, and become informed was very endearing."
1799,4,"Really liked it! I got this as a ""free read"" and read it the same night.  Very well written, somewhat of a short story so it moves rather quickly into the storyline.  I feel the characters Ty & Gwen were written very realistically, Ty had a better grasp on who he was & what he wanted; but Gwen feels that what she wants is wrong, and that there is something wrong with her because she craves a little pain/pleasure mix.  I labeled this happily ever after because that's how I feel the story went, kind of a Bdsm version of a fairytale. I would definitely recommend this story & author for future reading."
1800,5,I have read them all and these paranormal romance ebooks rock!! I am an avid fan of Heather and her stories!!! Read Redeemer and all her ebooks you will LOVE them too!!!
1801,4,I enjoyed reading this book. I liked the story and how it kept my attention from beginning to end. I will continue to check out this authors other books.

1804,3,"This is a short review, for a solid and decent book in the very fun PsyCop series. If you haven't read any book in this series yet, please check out my reviews of the first two books in this series Among the Living and Criss Cross.  I am a fan of Jordan Castillo Price's and of this series, but this book was just good -- not great; however, it is good and it is worth the read.  It felt like a bridge book, but having read further on in the series I can say that key things do happen in this book that are important.JCP is great about pushing the line in her urban fantasy world.  Ever wonder if lost limbs leave ghostly trails?  If a person has lost a hand, or a leg -- will its former limb appear as a ghost?  JCP answers that question in this book in a gruesome yet funny scene in which Vic is meeting Jacob's family for the first time.  In addition to the stress of attempting to impress his boyfriend's family, Vic is not using his prescription meds to dull his psychic senses (which the poor guy desparately relies on) and thus has to ignore the ghostly limb, while attempting to be coherent and friendly to his boyfriend's family -- all while sober.""I avoided looking at the spot where Leon's arm was flopping around on the table.""And as Vic laments to Jacob (after Vic flees the scene),""I am trying hard to be a decent boyfriend but I think I might not be cut out for it.""Body and Soul brings Vic and Jacob closer together.  With the typical introspective but witty inner dialogue that Vic employs, the reader is treated to Vic and Jacob's developing relationship.There is a decent mystery storyline and a cop investigation that is horror filled and gruesome.  This book is a fun and quick read.  Like the previous two books in the series, there is something about it that encourages compulsive behavior and I was not able to put it down -- I had to immediately go on to the next in the series.  But despite the addicting effect, Body and Soul is not the best book in the series, it is not great but it is good.  You will not be sorry you read it and you will learn some important things about Vic and Jacob together as a couple.  Body and Soul leads straight in to the fourth book in the series -- Secrets, which in my opinion is the best book thus far in PsyCop."
1805,3,"Grace is not your typical mother to a nine year old son. She burns cookies, sucks at housework, and generally has to make a huge effort to be domestic. What is she good at? Being a super agent of course. Nine years before, pregnant, shot by her lover Alex, the child's father; she makes a career change. Alex in the meantime has put together the Devlin agency and maintains two personages--that of Sean Devlin whom Grace thinks of as a best friend and confident as well as Alex Rossi, super agent! Grace has no idea that they are the same person. For some reason she never asks Sean why Alex shot her. She just assumes he put the job before her life and in order to achieve his objective to bring the bad guy down that is holding her hostage--he shoots her in order to get him.The story has so many unbelievable scenarios that in order to enjoy it for what it is--romantic suspense--you kind of have to suspend your belief in logic.This is a fast easy read. Don't expect it to make sense in terms of logic, plot etc. Stacey is weak on plot, but her dialogue and characters are fairly strong."
1806,5,"Yvonne, Willa, and Pippa are the princesses of Marchonland and they love their kingdom more than anything.  Their futures are in jeopardy!  Their aunt Aida and her long time lover, Gaspar, are planning a tournament to find the three woman husbands at the request of their dead mother, Kerrie.Five noble men are competing for a chance to win the beautiful princesses.  Gareth, Vinn, Banan, Edgar, and Gerard all have their individual reasons to vie for the women...their beauty and the exact stipulation of the Queen are definitely bonuses.Yvonne, Willa, and Pippa each have skills that are unique and help to keep their lands prosperous and safe.  Yvonne is fierce and a true warrior; Willa is gentle and keeps their lands productive and fertile; and Pippa is strong and has a way with the fine horses they breed.  The women cannot believe the stipulation that their mother included: the women not only have to marry but they have to be seduced by the men they choose.  None of the women want to marry as their mother married three times and each ended in death...for the husband.  Gareth, Edgar, and Gerard are working to win Yvonne's hand even though Gareth did not have to compete in the tournament and he has some very important information that he is not telling.  Vinn and Banan won the tournament and they are vying for Willa's hand or so they believe.  Aida and Gaspar have had their hands full raising the girls after Kerrie's death and they only want the best matches for their girls.  They will find them good mates even if they have to stretch the truth a bit to everyone including the princesses.  Will true love be found or is this just a disaster in the making?Passion's Four Towers is fun, sexy, and just a very enjoyable read!  Yvonne, Willa, and Pippa are three women who will do anything to keep their lands safe, in their hands, and to avoid the horror of marriage.  Each one of the men trying to gain the ladies favor is sexy, appealing, and irresistible.  I loved seeing these couples interact and I was rooting for each one of them to find their true loves.  Dee Brice writes very sexy and fun stories and characters.  Passion's Four Towers was plain and simply...a very good time!Graciereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1807,3,"Simply put ...there's not much to the IHT via kindle.  It's never been a thick, million-page newspaper, but the kindle version seems to be even more brief.  I'm a IHT fan, but will purchse the kindle version on a day-to-day basis rather than monthly subscription."
1808,4,"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne?  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work.  It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism.  With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook.  Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may.  The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste.  Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the `science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the ""speculative"" portion to explore human nature.  Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this.  And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost.  However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well.  We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions.  The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed.  Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular ""twenty thousand leagues"" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks.  There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly.  Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base.  Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as ""inoffensive creature[s],"" he gleefully slaughters a herd of ""cruel, mischievous"" sperm whales.  Hardly sustainability at its best.  But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology.  Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design).  Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented.  Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by ""foul air.""Verne wrote at an exciting time.  The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid.  We were just beginning to understand electricity.  The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered.  Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon.  There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion.  Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given.  It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword.  I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968.  It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would).  These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel.  It also contains a ""backword"" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine."
1809,5,Brace yourself for a very hot ride between these 2 co-workers who finally take their mutual attraction for each other to the other level! The novel itself is relatively short (i read it in 8 hours)...but it packs a very powerful punch. Loved the ending banter between the other office co-workers. Eagerly hoping there is a part 2 as I loved Mya and Milo together!
1810,4,I'm not too much into paranormal romance novels but I must say that Caleb is a man's man. He knows what he wants and he goes about getting it. In this case he wants Sommer and boy does he get her. A good read.
1811,4,"I love romance and this delivered. The ""magic"" realm of it was a bit different for me but it was enjoyable."
1812,5,"I thought after I had read the book about St John's older brother Marcus that I wouldn't really like this book. Turns out I  was wrong. I felt that he had legitimately changed into a new person without losing the person he was before. I read this in 1 or 2 days, if it can keep me reading like that it gets a 5!"
1813,4,"Well written, good character development and enjoyable.  The uber-alpha falling for the meek & weak of the pack gives a new twist to pack mentality stories. The only thing I would like to have seen was more development of the weaker character by the end of the story, not only to prepare her for upcoming battles, but to show her growth & development in her relationship as well as her personally."
1814,3,A well written kids book that I enjoyed all the same. Life was just so miserable in that era and the weight of depression just hangs on even with a change in fortune.
1815,3,"A great beginning for this fun and spicy series!! Keil is the definition of possessive alpha male in this story. While I loved reading about Keil & Robyn worked through their ""communication issues,"" turning this story into one I've never read about before. I recommend this book and series for anyone who likes to read a werewolf (slightly erotic) romance.Reviewed by: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and get a teaser on my blog)"
1816,2,"Romance novel (rippling muscles, meaningful glances, encounters in the tent, that sort of thing).  Won't read another.  But okay if you like to kill an afternoon with mind candy."
1817,5,I am a big fan of Christine Feehan. Have enjoyed all of her series'. Particularly love the Leopard People series. Will read anything written by Christine Feehan!!!!!
1818,4,"I loved this book. It was one of the first books I bought for my new Kindle and I thought I did rather well. I bought this one simply because I wanted to read a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story. I got much more than I bargained for and loved every minute. It was one of those books that made me sad when I had finished it because I wanted it to keep going on. Loved the prince - what a great character and Beauty herself, is a very worthy and unusual heroine.It is funny and sad and a great commentary on our treatment of beauty queens. I liked the ending. It was totally unexpected but brilliant.The sorceress behind the scenes is a marvellous character.I absolutely love this author and I hope she writes many more of her quirky fairy tales because I certainly will be grabbing them."
1819,4,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story, it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
1820,5,This series of love was just what I expected of Mrs. Jackson. She never disappoints! I've been a fan of hers for long time. I recommend all her series.
1821,5,"The name did not strike me as familiar, but I took the plunge anyway. Well worth the effort too, I might add. A classic author of Golden Age, or perhaps just post-Golden Age sci-fi. Really, Piper might be the missing link between 'high' Golden Age space opera and post-WWII cold war fever. I feel like I knew this author before, once I had read him, even though I am fairly certain I never read any of his stuff when it was originally in print, or out of it."
1822,5,"I'm totally in love with Lila Dubois and her Monsters in Hollywood series.  I grabbed this as a free read and am so glad I did! The second I finished this book I downloaded book 2, My Fair Monster!Clever premise, excellent writing, lovable characters and blistering hot sex!  I had to crank up the A/C!The main romantic characters, Michael the monster and Lena the hollywood power player, come through an amazing journey in a short time but it just works.  It's not rushed as some books would have main characters go from strangers to engaged in sixty seconds.  You feel his worry over her acceptance of his monster form, her struggle to love all parts of him, and the obstacles in their way.  The timing of their acceptance of each other and their emotions is perfect.  The dialogue was great, the stories behind their names - hilarious!  The monsters sneaking into homes to watch movies of humans is wonderful.Don't miss this book or this series!"
1823,4,"Sexy cowboy, sexy bad boy, secret romance, betrayal, man on man loving, and really hot sexy scenes that push some boundaries &#8211; that&#8217;s Unbridled. Not only does it cover just about every possible variation within a m&eacute;nage between two men (one dominant, one on the submissive side, yet still alpha) and a submissive woman who will only bow in the bedroom (well, during sexy time), but it also touches upon social issues &#8211; poverty, status, unconventional relationships and the difficulties that such couples (trios, really) have to overcome. There&#8217;s story and plenty of sexy, and seriously hot Dominance and submission games."
1824,1,"This is the worst book I have read from this Author. I have enjoyed her series before like the powertools. This however is just crap!!Becca is a student/graduate now doctor in a physiology practice on a college campus. Kurt is the doctor. Both have a thing for each other and she volunteers for an sexual experiment. The dream machine can record her dreams and hers are about Kurt.Seriously though the language the girl/woman uses is inappropriate for such a repressed character. How they talk to each other in the experiments is pathetic, who hell says I'm going to take you now?'It was just a novel of soft porn with bondage and sex toys chucked in. I couldn't even finish it.Poorly done Ms Rylon and I normally enjoy your books"
1825,5,"T.M. Roy's novel Discovery - A Far Out Romance - is a fun mix of ET and formulaic romance genres.  The main protagonist is male, rather than female, and an open-minded scientist who encounters an alien female.  Most of the story is spent trying to get the alien back to her ship and people, with assorted evil government agents and SETI types to complicate the return effort.  Of course the story has a HEA, in keeping with the stereotypical romance, but it is entertaining none the less.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light SF/F read with a more serious message about acceptance."
1826,3,"This was an okay book.  Kind of predictable, but I did read it all.I would read another book by this author."
1827,4,This was a great read. I am really glad I downloaded it. I didn't want to put it down. I would recommend reading the mysterious island.
1828,5,Enjoyed this holiday read and then purchased the box set which included this and 9 other enjoyable holiday romance reads! Fun and don't have to be read over the holiday just all take place during the holidays.
1829,5,Lori foster has captured my attention with her stories. she gives great detail and her stories have an excellent plot.
1830,5,This was a great sexy short story.  You can read it in about an hour. Sexy and romantic.  I recommend it.
1831,3,"I was really looking forward to reading My Father's Mask because I haven't ever read anything from Joe and was wondering if he wrote anything like his father. Well, he definitely writes strange books like his father but I'm not sure if I really liked it. It wasn't a bad story but definitely strange. I'd recommend it to my friends and let them make their own judgement on it."
1832,4,Albert Simon held my attention in each of his books I have read.  You feel like you know the people he creates.
1833,5,"As usual, this chapter in the Zombie Chronicles was great. I'm glad that Clodi decided to tell Hank n Juan' s story and, even though he said at the end of this book that their story would not be continued, I see elsewhere that there will be a book titled Undead Advantage 2, so I am hoping that he has had a mind change about that.  Now I'm off to see if there are anymore that I have not read and am praying that he is almost ready to release book five of the main series. Hope so.... I am not a very patient person. Smile!"
1834,5,"This game is very interesting! Although not worth the money, still the sample is fabulous. It lets you play the game, at least. This is one game where I do NOT need that card that I don't yet have."
1835,5,"Bought and Paid For really delivers on three main things. First, there are some strong and memorable characters. Second, the sex scenes are very hot. And third, the historical detail is convincing and effective. Strongly recommended."
1836,4,A good story with unexpected twists that really made it a pleasure to read. Very satisfied with this book. The ending was great.
1837,5,"This is the first three of the blood runner books.  You can read the series out of order, but it's awesome to read them in order- if you can.  Reading the bundle, is like reading one huge really good story- in three acts."
1838,5,"This story was HOT!  I haven't given very many 5 star ratings this year and I would give this more if I could.  Playboy Nick Sinclair is desperate for a pretend wife to land a huge business deal and along comes Laney Parks who is the opposite of the ""cookie cutter"" women that Nick is normally with.  Laney is more than Nick has bargained for, and he has to struggle with giving up his playboy lifestyle or lose Laney forever. This story had the perfect mix of romance, and I loved the way the book flowed and got right to the point.  The author didn't put in a lot of fluff, and the sex scenes were HOT! I'm not a timid person and I want to read hot, steamy, sizzling sex scenes and Tiffany Ashley brought that in this book, plus there were some laugh out loud moments.  I love reading interracial romance novels, especially BW/WM but I don't want the issue to become about race but the romance, and this book did that.  I paid a little more for my Kindle download than what is listed now but it was definitely worth it.  I will be looking for more from this author."
1839,5,"I found this book to be a very enjoyable read and a new twist to science fiction. I hope Mr. Erickson keeps writing this kind of sci-fi. He has the talent. I would like to see his book in a 3D movie, imagine the special effects."
1840,2,"This book is BORING. I downloaded it because the premise is interesting and it had good reviews. Wrong. Have you ever joked about how in books and movies you never see people eating or going to the bathroom? This book is a testament to why that is. It is not interesting to read about. The story has a lot of potential--a suspicious disappearance, a mysterious cat, shady politicians, a police cover-up--and despite all this the protagonist spends most of the time getting her train ticket punched. The author makes a big deal about the strange cat who follows her around, but once they get underway it literally does nothing but poop in the hotel room. The title should be ""Miranda Eats a Meat Pie for Dinner"" because that's all she really accomplishes (Seriously, someone should count up all the time they mention meat pies because it's a lot. I would do it but I think my eyes would melt if I read one more boring word of this book). It's really painfully obvious from the beginning what happened to the husband, and who is the bad guy, and the ""truth"" about magic. I am mostly annoyed that the author took the time to create this whole interesting, complex universe and then didn't do anything with it. The parts about the magicians are waaaay more interesting than Miranda reading a newspaper. Which she does. A lot. I only finished it to find out what happens, and that was disappointing too. The point, this book is boring and you should not read it. Now I'm going to eat, for some reason I am craving a meat pie..."
1841,3,"I bought this book without reading the reviews. Getting on here now, it seems that they all pretty much agreed with me. This was a fantastic story and sucked me right in. Then it just ended. It felt like I read the first third of the book and then found the rest of the pages ripped out.When you are raised as an outcast, what happens when you suddenly find yourself a queen of the people who banished your parents? Then how do you act when you find out that the last few rulers have all been murdered? Well, we don't really know because the story just ended before finishing the plot line!As much as I enjoyed the story, I would recommend waiting to see if there is a second one before reading it. If this story is going to be finished in a second book, I would definitely recommend it though.This was easy to read and the characters grab you. The only downfall was that it leaves you swinging in the breeze at the end."
1842,1,"ten days into my trial subscription and i have decided to cancel. have read the wsj for 30 years and i guess i have one foot in the digital world and one in the analog world.i won't repeat all of the other comments, i can concur on the difficulties of making the transition to kindle reading. if i was still in a job that had me traveling alot it might make sense but since i pick up my wsj of my front porch it just doesn't work.the one thing that really baffles me is how to cancel a free trial. unless the magic button is hiding right out in the open, i can't find a website or kindle method to cancel. i had to call into customer service and yes, it got taken care of but i was disconnected three times before i made it into the queue, the fidelity of the call made it almost impossible to understand what the person was saying, and the english of the rep was spotty at best. not up to the usual amazon quality."
1843,4,This book was super hot and not what I thought it would be about. It is full of smoking hot love scenes and some definite paranormal thrown in as well. I would recommend this book you will fall in love with the characters and be looking for the next book when you are done to see what happens to Heath
1844,5,I have always had dogs and read dog books.  Recently got a kitten - turned big-boy cat and thought I might enjoy this book.  It was extremely difficult to read.  Almost caused me to have a panic attack.  If these things really go on out there - I guess I have been living under a rock.  A colleague was going to get it for his 9 year old daughter and I said NO  Not a book for kids to read.  I am hugging my big boy cat as I write this.  I will be on the lookout for any other Sisypuss vagabond cats out there from now on.AS BOB BARKER WOULD SAY:  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PET (and anyone else's you can afford to).
1845,5,"this was the 1st gena showalter I had ever read and I loved it. It was a freebie on my kindle and I quickly ordered the others in the series, looking forward to reading them and many others of Ms Showalters"
1846,4,"This was a pretty good first read from Leah Braemel for me. She had some highs and a few lows but there were enough aspects of this story I enjoyed that I'm intrigued to try something else from her. Some of my likes: I enjoyed the connection between Jodi and Mark. I thought they had some great heat that steamed up the pages and made me want more. And it wasn't just their sexual energy that I enjoyed; I thought that they had a great emotional connection as well. I enjoyed the aspect that both cared more for the other than they could admit. They started this relationship as a way to scratch an itch but it developed in to so much more for them both. Probably the only thing that I did not fully enjoy was some aspects of the m&eacute;nage. Normally I'm pretty open to this but there were one or two portions that I did not enjoy very much. Otherwise, a really entertaining spicy read and I would look forward to trying something else by Ms. Braemel."

When Riley is released from prison on a technicality, he's hellbent on finishing the job once and for all. Lucas tries to live some semblance of a life, opening his own bookstore, but he's haunted by scars, both emotional and physical, which prevents him from trusting others and allowing them to get close. Nicholas Demetris has been in love with Lucas for five years and is determined to prove that they would be great together. As Lucas and Nicholas struggle with their feelings for one another, a more dangerous and deadly threat is on the horizon.I enjoyed this short story, which was a very quick read. Riley's thoughts were disturbing and really showed the depth of his madness and delusion. The love story between Lucas and Nicholas was sweet and I admired Nicholas for never giving up on Lucas or his love for him."
1848,4,"this book engaged me immediately with a blockbuster of a first chapter. the protagonist, Emerson ward, is a likable writer with a moral compass that guides him into danger and adventure. above average mystery/adventure that keeps you turning pages until the very end."
1849,4,"I enjoyed read books by Maya Banks, they have good storylines and characters are very loveable. In this story we see how Emily cope with lost of her husband and love for Donovan brothers. A good read and would tell my friends."
1850,2,"I really enjoyed the first book in the series, but this entry just fell flat for me.I felt as if I knew everything that was going to happen before it happened.  Tanner and Maddie just didn't have the chemistry that Charlie and Brittany had.  The sex scenes were a bit rote and their conflict was very easily resolved.  I'm not ready for love.  Oh, you want love?  Okay, I'm ready to love again!).I'm a fan of Erickson, so I'll continue to read her work -- I think was just a case of this not being the right book for this reader."
1851,5,"I think this is a great blog, especially for someone looking for free books and good reads. It's like the public library. Not every book offered is going to be something wonderful or a topic you're interested in. Face it, you're paying a pittance a month to hear about free Kindle books and Kindle tips all in one place. Also, you don't even have to search for these items on Amazon.com. Mr. Gallagher gives you a direct link in the blog to go to them.I currently have over 25 free books on my Kindle I haven't read yet. All from the comfort of my own home. I still buy Kindle books, but I'm glad to have a resource for people who just like to read.I would suggest not subscribing if all you want is new releases from known authors."
1852,1,"i thought the n.y. times was a morning daily.  i'm on the west coast.  in new york, it's nearly noon.  i haven't received today's paper yet.  i left wireless on all night, and have been reading other kindle content all morning.  is this standard?"
1853,5,"High speed mental bubble gum, Doc's books were friends in my youth, and I still enjoy reading them now.  When you want an escape from the every day grind, check these writings out and enjoy!"
1854,5,love it so much if it anything like the last one its going to be great..... Try it for your child
1855,5,"I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut, fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author, Mr Camacho, made Hannibal a very human hero, who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!"
1856,5,I am always thrilled with Jennifer Crusoe' s books. She writesa great book. I have loved them all. I always look forward to her new books.
1857,3,"I enjoyed the beginning part of this book more than the last third.***Spoilers***I get really frustrated in romance books where either the h or H decide they aren't good enough for the other. However in this book during the first half it was the H who felt he wasn't good enough and the second half it was the h, plus she had other issues too. It was a bit too much for me to have both of them wavering and after they'd had an intimate relationship I would've liked to have seen more commitment, it wasn't realistic for the time period."
1858,5,"This book was full of amazing things.  Adventure, magic, sci-fi, romance, enhanced humans, humor, friendship, loyalty, good and evil, discoveries.  It's free.  Get it and set aside a large chunk of time as you won't be able to put it down! Loved it.  Can't wait to read the next in the series."
1859,3,I definitely feel for Mercedes but I did not like the ending at all. I hate  when books just stop with no real ending.
1860,4,"3 1/2 stars.  I thought this was a well written story, but I had trouble feeling any romance till the very end.  There was sex--a lot of it, but I didn't feel the intimacy between the characters.  I don't expect instant love I romance novels, but I felt it took too long for feelings to start.  The hero was gruff and alpha.  The heroine was pretty strong willed, but I wish she had more backbone when it came to the H--let him chase her for once.  I did enjoy the suspense story line.  It flowed well, and had plenty of action.  It's what brought my rating up to 3 1/2 stars.  This is the first book I read from this author, and I will try another one.  I enjoyed the writing style."
1861,5,"This was a very touching story about a father overcoming his own fears when his daughter comes into the world. Also reconnecting with his wife after pushing her away because of being scared of losing her in childbirth. It along with the other Black Dagger Brotherhood books I could not put down and loved reading. For me it was like I was in their world instead of mine, and that is what I feel a good book should do. Cannot wait for the next book to come out next March."
1862,3,"This book was a good way to finish out the series and explain how the relationships between the brothers and their wives concluded but it lacked the wow factor that the previous 3 books contained. The excitement and thrill just weren't present, could have easily been condensed and added at the end of the 3rd book."
1863,5,"I think I enjoyed Amber Eyes a little more than Golden Eyes, and I thoroughly enjoyed that novella. Kaya was enjoyable to read and watch come to get use to the human world she had long since stopped from trying to enter. Also for Hunter and Jericho to learn to love again."
1864,4,"In the second installment of the Granite Lake Wolves series two high school sweethearts who have more in common than they ever could have imagined are reunited when one's life is threaten and another's is falling apart.Tad Maxwell is half wolf, half human and will not come into his wolf unless he has sex with someone else of his kind. But Tad refuses to give into his wolf and a meaningless liaison, his human side and principals rule too strong. And so he fights every day to bury that part of him. Until the girl he once loved shows up and turns his world upside down.Missy Leason is running from her pack and almost out of time. A viscous alpha wants to claim Missy and use her for her Omega powers, willing to break both human and wolf laws if that means a rise in his own power. Missy hopes that Tad can save her but that means confessing secrets and convincing him that they're more than just first mates, they're true mates. But when Missy's Alpha finds them she may not get the chance because Tad must face him in a fight...without the ability to shift into a wolf like his adversary.Wolf Flight was another great story from Vivian Arend, this time starring Robyn's (Wolf Signs) brother, Tad. With suspense and action that will keep you turning the pages for more and naughty sex scenes with frustrating tension, Wolf Flight had a fuller feeling to it then the first book in the series despite it's shorter length.Tad and Missy's story almost run side-to-side of Robyn and Keil's time-wise, so you get to see Tad's feelings on his sister's mating as well as his own. A sweet and likable character, I really enjoyed Tad. Missy was also a good character, determined and aggressive when it came to getting what she wanted (Tad) yet still soft and womanly. I'm looking forward to the next book!"
1865,4,"great light, fun summer reading --- love all the plots and just a good summer read ----this author writes good stories and I have read every one of her books and waiting for more."
1866,4,"3.5 Stars3/5 Hotness RatingKallysten has created a truly unique universe for her stories and this is only the second of her books that I've read that has been set in The Demons Age. I think that the setting and storyline for this time period is very exciting and adds a unique twist to an already fascinating world.Marc is a vampire that believes in the long ago made Pacts with the humans. He and his Childe, Blake, fight the demons but Blake does it because he thinks it's fun more than anything else. One night while they were fighting they came across a group of human fighters and decided to join forces with them. Among them was a soldier named Kate to whom both found themselves attracted. I guess it was game on between those two from then on. There's nothing like a little rivalry when vying for a woman's attention.The relationship between Marc and Blake is something new to me. I've read a decent amount of Kallysten's creations and I've never come across a Sire/Childe relationship quite like their's before. The parent/child feel isn't there. Marc doesn't force Blake to obey in any way. In fact, Blake's a total pain in the ass. He's always trying to push Marc's buttons and he's awfully immature despite his many decades of life.The three main characters in this book were written extremely well. To put it simply, the were brought to life for me through Kallysten's words. It was like I was watching the story play out before my eyes. I was able to feel Kate's confusion over her conflicting emotions for the two vampires. I disliked Blake's childlike behavior towards Marc. When Marc felt exasperated by Blake's antics I was right there with him and I can easily envision myself smacking Blake upside the head. I love it when a read feels real like that.Since this is only the first in a trilogy about the same set of lovers, a lot of the book was built on the character building. As you can tell, I think Kallysten did a fabulous job with it. I missed the smoldering love scenes though. The scene between Marc and Blake was brief and the other scene in the story was only a murky dream. I look forward to reading the next book and getting deeper into the attraction between the three."
1867,5,If you don't care for a lot of swearing or big sex scenes this is a book you will enjoy. It is a mystery and it is a good journey to the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
1868,1,This is rubish of a story and should not be in the alternate history cataloge.I feel that if you gave away this book for free for whats in it it is too expensive. If this was writen on paper its only worth would be to recycle the book into cardboard.
1869,4,"I very much enjoyed the ending, but how anyone would take their twin sister's role as a Dom when clearly they are timid is a bit... stupid. Besides that, I found the begining of the story a bit akward, but very much enjoyed how it eventually played out. Its a decent read."
1870,3,"I enjoyed The Breed Next Door, but it needs to be longer. I felt as though I didn't really know either character, so I wasn't invested in them. It was an enjoyable read, but definitely needs to be longer."
1871,5,"Nice innocent read for the whole family. Can't beat the free price either, so don't be afraid to download to kindle."
1872,4,"It's time for my first indie book review! And for my first, I thought that I would dive right in with the horror/thriller story, Serial, by Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn (aka JA Konrath).Goodreads description:Remember the twin golden rules of hitchhiking?#1: Don't go hitchhiking, because the driver who picks you up could be certifiably crazy.#2: Don't pick up hitchhikers, because the traveler you pick up could be raving nutcase.So what if, on some dark, isolated road, Crazy #1 offered a ride to Crazy #2...This story was a short, quick read, written in a very unique way. According to the info at the back of the book, Kilborn and Crouch each built their killer, and their killer's pre-story before sharing what they had with one another. Then, they collaborated and finished it up together. Sounds sweet, huh?It's anything but sweet. As far as stories about kindred souls finding each other go, this one was dark as all hell. Even in such a short format, Crouch and Kilborn are able to stick you into the warped minds of their characters, and make you never want to be on the side of the road again. It's gory and perverted and definitely not for people with queezy stomachs.I give it umm... (wow, hadn't thought of a rating system so I guess I'll be generic for now) 5 Stars. I was hooked from page one, Serial is well written and the characters grabbed my attention. I would recommend Serial for anyone that wants a quick and bloody read.I wish it was longer, but to be fair, there is a longer story out there, Serial Uncut, that I haven't picked up yet. This one is only available in ebook format, and I got mine for free, on Amazon.com."
1873,4,"I enjoy novellas. I seek them out. If you add a touch of paranormal and a Sherlock Holmes-type setting - you will have my attention.This ebook was a quick read. I downloaded it ages ago when it was offered as a Kindle freebie.I enjoyed Henkel's writing style. It was descriptive and dramatic. Others may not care for that, but I enjoyed the detail of scenery, weather, fast action, and creepy locations.What ended up lacking for me was the story line. Why is Dark a ghost hunter? Who employs him? Why was siu Lin out of her native country, etc. So many thing left unexplored.Henkel would make a fine young adult author. He has the pacing and touch for detail to be a good one.A nice start to a series. I'll read more - four stars."
1874,4,I am becoming a fan of Rebecca Forster and this book was no exception. It was well written along with believable characters that drew me into their lives. I found the book to be very interesting and surprised by many of the turn of events which is what a good mystery should do. I plan on reading more of her books.
1875,1,"This book turned my stomach; I didn't make it very far in.  Being tied to a tree, in the middle of a public park, and being &#34;ravaged&#34; the very first time you meet someone,  is not my idea of a good time."
1876,3,"After finishing this book, I don't know exactly how to feel.I expected to feel horrified, and at certain points I was, perhaps not at the points Steve intended, but generally speaking I felt a little disjointed.I believe this was because of the choppy way the story went from one place and time to another and then another. I don't have a solution to make it better; I just know that I didn't really get it.The introduction to the 'world' took a long time. Almost a third of the book! It held useful information, but it felt like I was being introduced to characters, ideas and concepts just to have them ripped away. You don't meet the real protagonist until about 30% in either. That meant you only had 70% of the book left in which to get to know them and feel something for them.It took a while, but eventually I did start to care for a couple of the characters. I think the kicker for me though, the turning point in my feelings for the book, revolved solely around the dog. I felt more for that wiry-haired pooch than any of the other characters. That could be because I'm an animal person, but I don't think so. In fact I believe it's got more to do with the characterisation that the dog had that the other characters were lacking.The antagonists were brilliant creations of horrific proportions, but strangely humanesque in some of their actions, protecting their young and mates for example, and so completely alien in other aspects.I didn't really appreciate the dialogue around them and their existence in their world; I think it would have been enough knowing that they came from a hellish world without all the rest of it too.The thing that kept me engaged and enjoying this story was the science/history behind the different worlds. The ley lines and the Indian culture, the standing stones and the magic that was obviously so thoroughly researched by Steve. That part of the story was steeped in so much truth that even though it was completely 'out there' I found myself wanting to believe it too.I didn't much like how things ended, but then I can't say I didn't expect it a little anyway. Steve seemed to enjoy mutilating characters, finding creative ways to dispatch them from the story and well, I guess I came to expect that any characters were potential targets, even those who deserved a second chance at things or ones who were young and innocent.This book is certainly not for the feint-hearted. It starts off slowly enough, but by the end of it you'll be wading through so much blood and guts it all just starts to blur together.This book could do with another pass over by an editor. There were plenty of little typos and formatting issues on the kindle.The things I noticed:15% - now it (was) just weeds.23% - that's what is (delete is, add it) has to do...27% - A brownish shake's (snake's)...29% - the boat ramp..

1877,4,"I've read a few other Kelly Jamieson books and this one was the best so far.  I liked both the hero & heroine and was rooting for them all the way.  I thought the relationship seemed believable between Kerri & Mitch and I was glad they didn't just fall into bed right away.  The only relationship that seemed a little rushed was Kerri & her sister Sela.  I thought the resolution between them was too quick & neat.  Overall, this was a good story."
1878,4,"The Code of Hammurabi, from the third millenium B.C.E., was an attempt to encode various laws into a fairly straight forward justice system. Numerous specific crimes are mentioned, along with very specific punishments. Most of the crimes revolve around things dealing with farming, buying and selling things, and debts.Punishments ranged from paying a fine (in money or goods/animals), to somewhat much more severe, like having a hand cut off, all the way to death. Some of the things I found most interesting are as follows:Threaten a witness? You die.Judge makes a mistake in giving the penality? Out of a job.Steal. Depends who you steal from. If you're rich, you pay 30 times the amount stolen; if poor, you pay ten times the amount stolen. The laws seemed to be fairly balanced in this way, the penalty in money or goods higher for the rich person than for a poor person.If a woman opens a wine house? She dies.If a wife has sex with some other guy and is caught, they are tied together and drowned.If a wife is very ill, the guy can take another wife but must still take care of the first one.If a son has sex with his mother and they are caught, both are burnred to death.If a son strikes a father, one of his hands is cut off.If a guy causes another guy to lose an eye or break a limb, the same will be done to him.If a guy hits a pregnant woman and she dies, thus losing the baby, then, if the guy has a daughter, she dies.There's also a whole section on the fees various people can charge, including doctors, vets, house builders and ship builders.All-in-all a very harsh system of laws, but in some ways, especially the rich paying a much stiffer penalty than the poor, most fair than today's laws."
1879,5,It's nice to have an old stanby.  Stories still absorbing  Short enough to be read in less than an hour.  Variety good
1880,2,"Gave up about half way through.  Too much repetition, too much that didn't make sense and was hard to follow."
1881,5,I have many religous readings in my library.  This is one of them.  It is nice to pull it out and read it.  The price of being free is right and worth the room.
1882,5,"Nicole Zoltack's WOMAN OF HONOR weaves the tale of the first lady knight of Arnhem. Sprinkled with historical facts, bullies, and a good dose of love and honor, WOMAN OF HONOR is a coming of age novel set in the fantastical medieval world of Arnhem Kingdom. Aislinn is brave and truly grows to be a woman of honor. The characters are likeable and realistic. We feel Aislinn's pains while she tries to prove herself. She overcomes tradition and the growing threat of Speica. This novel has history, knights, and mythological creatures and is filled with intrigue, mystery, horror, and, most important of all, love. In this first book of the Kingdom of Arnhem series, I feel like we touch upon their lives and a conflict looming in their future. By the end, I craved more from this fantastical world, and I'm glad Ms. Zoltack supplied it in her next book."
1883,5,"Heather Killough-Walden's new release, ""Hell Bent,"" kept me up reading at 2:00 in the morning even though I had to be up at 6:00 a.m. Combination thriller and love story, the two main characters, Annabelle and Jack, have been in a platonic relationship for ten years, although they are each others best friend, confidante and overall most important person in the world, as well as being significantly attracted to each other. Annabelle is a beauty who turns heads without realizing it. She is a hockey-loving, Harley-riding, graphic artist - feisty but vulnerable and an overachiever with her flaws which she deals with through good humor, self-deprecation and Vicodin. Jack, with his British accent, hauntingly light eyes and rugged good looks, leaves women in his wake and barely notices because he only has eyes for Annabelle, whom he alone calls Bella. His need to be constantly married to women other than Annabelle, as well as his career choice, has left Annabelle content with the status quo of their relationship. However, the sexual tension that results from their mutual devotion is incredibly effective, while eluding overt description. This isn't the ""will they or won't they kiss"" tension delivered teasingly over and over. It is something much more complicated and far more stirring. When Annabelle finds herself involved in a murder, Jack's willingness to do whatever it takes to protect his Bella becomes apparent and he takes her and an extended cast of characters from one safe spot to another as together they investigate the murder. ""Hell Bent' is a masterful telling by an author who delivers brilliantly complex relationships, scenes with staying power, and a story that manages to be sexy, thrilling, poignant and thought-provoking. The most fun I have had reading in a while."
1884,5,The Henry Wright mysteries never disappoint me. Very good stories. They always catch my attention and I have a hard time putting them down.
1885,5,Good reading for anyone of any age. It is a book that could be shared with kids of any age from five to ninty five and learn so much from the experience of these time travelers.
1886,5,Gage and Hailey are so perfect for each other. 1st book in a series of 3. The banter between the brothers at breakfast is so good! I laughed out loud! I highly recommend these books. Gage and Hailey are so smokin' hot! Yowza! soooo good!
1887,5,This is part of a series I read and I loved the whole series I also have some on Kindle.
1888,5,"I love this story..it's so touching, beautiful & fulfilling. Thank you Ms McCray for sharing such a beautiful love story."
1889,4,My first book from this genre and I was hooked. Leo the stud muffin salivates when near one of the office girls whom he has only seen from the rear. After careful planning he makes it his mission with the help of another to get to meet her and hopefully win her around. The story evolves with twists about the man that I didn't expect as I didn't read any reviews and bought this purely because it was a cheap read and needed something to read one evening. I'm glad that I took the chance because if I had read the details I probably would have passed. I'm reading the second book in this saga and fully intend to read the third next. I have bonded with the characters as the writer makes them interesting and personable.I will definitely read more from this author as I like her style but find the graphic sex not warranted as the characters stand alone and win your interest purely on their own merit. A rewarding tale that keeps your interest as you are introduced to other family members each with a story of their own to tell.
1890,3,"I have read 100's of Sci Fi novels and am trying to broaden my reading horizons. I liked the characters in the Amazon's Curse, but they needed to be developed more so the story would be longer (It was just too short). I had the feeling that this story was put together in a hurry, but I can't complain since it was free."
1891,4,"I read the Divine Series years ago and loved it! Divine Beginnings has been sitting on my e-read for over a year, honestly I totally forgot it was a novella. This novella is the prequel to the Cast's Partholon series and it explains how the war started. I really enjoyed  Aine and Tegan's story! I know this is a novella but I was sad that it was over so quick, I wanted to know more about their lives together!If you have read anything else by P.C. Cast, you know how good she is at making a very vivid world. I was once again transported to the magical Kingdom of Partholon. Even though it time it wasn't nearly as vivacious as in the series, I had no problem seeing the world Tegan and Aine loved so much that they were willing to risk their relationship to save it.I had almost forgotten that this was series was where I remember The Goddess from. Just like in the House of Night series, The Goddess is such a power being in Partholon. I love how she manifest herself when she is most needed and how Aine puts her full trust in her and follows that down a path that is completely against everything she has come to know.I might have to go back and read The Partholon series again! Just so I can tell you guys exactly what I loved about it!"
1892,4,"I enjoyed this book.  I've read reviews on it where some said they were offended by the fact that ""a black woman could be sold to a white man"".  The story wasn't anything dirty like that.  And, that would be a fair argument if this wasn't a plot that has been used many times by writers with characters being the same race and, no one complained.  So, to those people I say don't read IR books if you're against IR relationships."
1893,4,Interesting read with plenty of twists & turns. Didn't want to put it down. Finished it in just over 24 hours.
1894,5,"This was a steamy and well written story with some interesting twists to the plot. I enjoyed it immensely. I didn't feel like I was left hanging like I do with many of the short stories. It had a beginning, a good story line and an a satisfactory ending. Well worth the read!"
1895,4,"loved the honesty of both the characters and the story. the sex was great, but even better was that it didn't replace a good story and a satisfying read."
1896,4,"Rating: 4Mara: 3.5 - I wanted to strangle her a few times!!Dash: 4.5 - Loved him, s**y as sin!!Secondary Characters: 4 - Jerrick & Piper was awesome!!Steam Level: 4Storyline/Plot: 4Setting: 3.5 - Loved the world-building but would have liked a little more background into the worldGenre: Romantic FantasyCover: 4 - YummmEnding: HEAI really enjoyed this book. Jodi done an amazing job of catching my attention and drawling me into the story. It was full of action, drama and s**y as sin! The world was very interesting and the characters jumped off the pages. It was a fun, action packed, swoon-worthy book. I have become a new fan of Jodi and she is going on my authors-to-stalk list."
1897,3,"Yes, it is a very short story with graphic sex and is sweet without being too saccharine.  It does not have a lot of details or story line but for a quick free read it was worth the time.Chloe is a very shy introvert that is set up by her sister with Mark, wealthy(of course) but with scars.  They have sex, fall in love, separate because of misunderstandings and then, of course, HEA.Not much to it as others reviewers have mentioned but I did enjoy reading the book unlike some other short, free reads I have downloaded.  I really did not have high expectations especialy based on the length of the book but it did give me a sample of the writing style of the author and I may give one of her longer books a try.If your looking for something with a lot of plot and ""meat"" to it - pass on this book.  While this book is not what I would consider a keeper, it was enjoyable for a quick free fix."
1898,5,This story is a great continuation in the series. I loved it and enjoyed just like all the others. The characters just continue to grow on me as I read this series. Can't wait to read the next one.
1899,2,"Why ruin a good book with sex scenes?This was a hard book to read, but that was to be expected- it's very depressing subject matter.  It was well handled, though, fairly well written for the most part. I would give it a 3 or 4 star rating, if it wasn't for the 2 sex bits. They didn't fit the rest of the story, and pulled me out of it completely. Unnecessary, ill-suited to the story. If not for that, this would have been a good story from a unique viewpoint."
1900,4,"I love the New Yorker on the Kindle.  No advertisements which is a big plus.  I compared several issues page by page, and found them to be compatible, at least the material that I read.  You don't get the article illustrations, and you don't get all the cartoons. I believe that the ""Goings On About Town"" is abbreviated. I don't really care about any of the missing items.My only disappointment is that a Kindle subscription does not give you access rights to the New Yorker's online archive with your PC.  I had a print subscription and have used the online archive.  When I let my print subscription lapse because I had got the Kindle subscription, I was denied access to the online archive. I emailed New Yorker subscription service.  They replied back that a Kindle subscription does not qualify one for access to the archives, only the print subscription does.If access to the online archive is important to you, the Kindle subscription may not be a wise choice."
1901,4,I'm proud to say that this book has indeed given me things to think about and help me with a course of action. Thank you.
1902,3,I kept reading to see what would happen next but there were a lot of typos & mixed words so I am glad this was a free book.
1903,5,This story is well thought out. It was also very well written. About two lonely individuals meeting and truly connecting with one another.
1904,3,"This review is split into two sections. The first section has to do with the subject matter and how it is presented. The second has to do with how it was formatted for Kindle.Part 1I picked this up for my Kindle because I teach The True Story of Hansel and Gretel. The main characters in the book flee from the Bialystok ghetto, and it is difficult to find detailed infromation.Midler's story almost seems designed as if it was something he told and then typed, which is possible because he did present to a class in CA. This makes the style at times slightly disconcerting, especially towards the end of the book. Midler chronicles his life during the war, as the only member of his immediate family to survive as well as his experiences during the birth of Isreal, his travels to the United States, and his return to Europe. The book not only allows the reader a view into not only the war but into the current situtation in the Middle East. Not only that, but Midler ties the events into current events.Part 2However, the reason why I gave it three stars instead of the four it deserves is that the Kindle edition is very badly formatted. There repeatitive FFFFFFFF (multiple letters), huge chunks of paragraphs are repeated and chapter headings sometimes appear in the middle of sentences. This doesn't happen on every page, but it happens enough to be very, very annoying. The formatting lets down the importance of the story, for this is something that should be read and should be used in schools."
1905,5,This is my favorite one of the series so far. Working on book 4 tommorrow hope it is as good as the one.
1906,5,"loved this read kept me questioning who next, where is so and so at, and arent they gonna get together, i liked very much, cant wait to read the second part."
1907,5,"Where do I start, this book was so hot I had my mouth open the whole time.Sin-Bad, A corny name yes but this Vamp is so hot I was able to overlook the name and many other sins.This is a M/F/M m&eacute;nage, a little bondage and in the beginning there is a M/M scene that is brief and does not involve the main characters.I loved how the writer took creative license and changed how we view vampires.These vampires are not afraid of daylight, they can eat, and one cooks. Garlic does not bother them and they do cast a reflection.They are simply three extra strong and horny brothers/ Aliens from another planet.Sin-Bad not Sinbad is so hot he it is unbelievable.For some reason I like that he does not make excuses for who he is and the fact that he will do whatever it takes to have things his way.Chandra is a intelligent woman of color who has worked hard to become a police detective. She is strong and determined to keep her independence.There is a brief battle of wills and a lot of scorching lovin.I loved it and as always, I'd love some follow up.I found this book after reading Marilyn Lee's latest addition to the (In Blood series)The Stoner brother and the a few of her other characters from other books are long time friends or acquaintances. In the new book by Marilyn Lee, Rayna talks about how Sebastian is most likely also in love with Chandra as if she is jealous.Marilyn must do another book and make it about Max or Sebastian. I want to see what will happen when Seb finds is blood and Chandra has to share her men.LOVED IT, NEED MORE LIKE IT IN MY LIFE,MARILYN I THANK YOU and MY HUBBY THANKS YOU TOO!HAPPY READING,MonaLisa"
1908,5,"Alexandra's ordinary world is shattered when a brooding man, Joshua, appears at her father's workshop and she discovers that her father a legendary and powerful alpha werewolf. And her, a female half breed werewolf, which brings a lot of complications.Female - she is rare and coveted by male werewolves. Worse still, she is currently in heat.Half-breed - Purist werewolves are out to kill her in order to prevent dilution of bloodlines.Werewolf - There are bounty hunters out to exterminate the werewolves.Alexandra has little choice but to trust and follow Joshua back to his pack's homeground while her father tries to draw off her pursuers. As the two get to know each other better while dodging bullets and pursuers, would Alexandra choose Joshua as a mate? But would Joshua, a rather prime male specimen of the werewolf species be interested in her, a half breed?Due to the romance developing between the couple during their desperate race back to the pack's turf, it keeps the readers on the edge and in suspense as to whether they will be able to make it back to the pack's turf and whether Alexandra's father would safely and successfully draw off the pursuers. Readers are also left wondering who's foe or friend as there's internal betrayal in the pack. Some of the minor characters are rather interesting, so it's a pity that not more is written about them, though I suppose that open avenues for future books?"
1909,5,"Having read other repairman jack stories, I was pleased to find this one.  However, this deals more in the realm of science fiction or fantasy than plain realistic action.  Still, the descriptions of the people and places of the Pine Barrens in NJ were very interesting and seemed realistic.  I always wondered what was between those far-apart exits on the NJ Turnpike...."
1910,5,"This was very well-written, in a romantic style.  At times, the author romanticizes war, then vilifies it.  Not that he is confused, I think that's how they related to things in that period.It still amazes me, and angers me, as a Belgian, how Germany managed to survive as a nation.  To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.  People who ridicule French military prowess have no idea of what they speak, and are, certainly, no students of history."
1911,3,"A really short &#34;Cliff-Notes-Esque&#34; essay on Margaret Atwood's book, &#34;Surfacing&#34; which dealt with the issues of national and gendered identity, anticipated rising concerns about conservation and preservation and the emergence of Canadian nationalism. The book is complex in the layering of the characters and subject matter with separation being forefront.Margaret Atwood's book has been compared to the likes of Jack Kerouac's On the Road, and to Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, and rightfully so. A fair comparison of this essay, Stopping the World, to Atwood's book would be like an essay on Herman Melville's Moby Dick with the contents of said essay stating that Moby Dick is about about a man and a fish. While true at a elementary level, would completely miss the point and that is my conclusion with this essay. it seems to completely miss the point of Atwood's message.However I must give merit for an imaginative piece that does try to make apple juice out of oranges."
1912,4,"If things could go wrong with Jill they did, but in the end she still got her man.  I've read some of  the authors other books and felt this was not as good as the other ones.  I know some people have a black cloud over them but not one this bad.  Jill still ended up with her man.  Some steamy  sex also."
1913,5,"The title alone had me counting on my figures to see what day it would be!!!! lol  I loved how the author dated and time scenarios!  I swear I think the closer it got, the faster my heart started beating!  Very enjoyable."
1914,5,"I really liked the whole of the series. I must admit that I seem to rarely rate anything at 5, but in this case couldn't find anything so bad as to need lower the score.One thing that maybe is a bit strange is that all of the series happen in a time-frame of apparently few weeks. Which means like the worlds is saved like 5 times within a month. If you can overlook this then it's ok"
1915,3,Really a typical story.  Probably a three star only due to the characters.  Actually a bit boring.  Hope next book is better
1916,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  Minx Malone did a great job creating believable characters along with a great back story.  I actually found it quite funny that through the story Mia and Milo are totally in love with each other and both think they're so smart with their little plans.  Mia believing that Milo doesn't feel anything for her so she is just going to enjoy a weekend of great sex, and Milo thinking that Mia doesn't love him so he has to come up with this super elaborate plan to seduce her mind, body, and soul.The chemistry between these two characters was great.  Being that they were both secretly in love with each but are also best friends makes for some interesting dialogue and situations.  I think one of my favorite parts of the whole story is how Mia tries to break Milo's concentration during their meeting, which she completely succeeds on.I thought each character had a good back story and I appreciated that they both had their own qualms and baggage right from the beginning.  Anyone that tells you that you can get into a relationship with zero baggage is full of it.Although there is definitely drama in this story I didn't feel like it was forced or unrealistic.  With how long Mia and Milo had been best friends, their trepidation was understandable.  And although I personally would've slammed the door in that girl's face and turned my full anger on Milo directly until he explained things to me, that's just me and the majority of people don't like confrontation.  So again, completely realistic to me that she acted the way she did when her feelings were hurt.I enjoyed reading about their exploration of each other.  Though they've both been wanting each other so bad they take their time getting to know each others bodies and are truly trying to find the things that make each other happy.  The only thing that I wished had been different would've been a clue as to their lives before she moved so I could've had a better idea of where they started out from.  Mia makes many references about leaving because of her feelings for Milo but I would've enjoyed finding out Milo's perspective on the whole thing.I also loved the set up for the other books in this collection.  I loved Andre's character immediately so I'm excited to read about his adventures.Lastly, the sex between these two is not only hot but very passionate as well which I appreciated.  Now I just need to decide what kinds of donuts I want to buy ;)"
1917,5,We all have things to overcome in this life.  This is a good self help book and easy to understand.
1918,5,Reading about Quentin and Suzanna was Awesome. Enjoyed reading about them from start to finish. Just wish to have been able to read more of them.
1919,4,"For two years Nathan `Nate' Summers has managed to elude his captor known only as the Teacher.  Nate has a special gift, a psychic talent the Teacher uses for monetary and personal gain.  He knows that he must keep moving to avoid being captured and controlled once more.The town of Wolf Creek looks like any other town on the surface but underneath lies a huge secret.  Many of the people who live in Wolf Creek are actually werewolf shifters.A general store burglary brings Nate and Sheriff Joe Nash together.  Soon after they meet Joe realizes that Nate is his mate.  Joe has every intention of wooing Nate and then mating him. But, Nate knows it's only a matter of time if he stays in one place too long the Teacher will find him.  Can Nate trust Joe to protect him and can Joe trust Nate to stay forever?  It does all come down to a simple matter of trust.Author Stormy Glenn gives readers another fun, steamy and suspense filled tale in Full Moon Mating.  There is a large cast of great characters yet the heroes manage to stand out with heart, intelligence and carnal encounters.  No big surprises in Full Moon Mating but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment factor!  You can always count on Ms. Glenn for a good story and Full Moon Mating is total entertainment.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
1920,4,"My Soul To Lose is a prequel novella to Rachel Vincent's popular series, Soul Screamers, which I have yet to read! While I think it probably isn't absolutely necessary to read this novella before the rest of the series, I found it to be a lovely introduction to the world and characters. It left me with a huge urge to read the first book which hopefully I'll get to do really soon! Sometimes novellas can be lacking in substance or feel like they were cut short but this one certainly wasn't.The story starts off with a bang. Kaylee Cavanaugh is trying to enjoy a day out with a friend but her 'panic attacks' are getting in the way of that. Kaylee's really having a tough time of it. She screams for no apparent reason and there's nothing she can do about it! Fearing she is mentally ill, she is admitted to a psychiatric unit and even had to be sedated for 15 hours. This story mostly takes place inside the unit. I've read a fair few books that feature psychiatric hospitals and I think of all of them, this one was the easiest to picture.Rachel Vincent's writing is just amazing! I could see everything clearly in my head and there was so much emotion throughout the story it was almost tangible. When Kaylee was having one of her attacks, it was described so well you could almost feel it yourself. You could sense her panic, fear and confusion. It really gets inside your head and makes you realize what Kaylee is going through. I just loved how real it all felt even if the circumstances and reasons behind it were a little surreal!This is definitely one to read in a single sitting. I was so captivated by the story, I couldn't tear my eyes away from Kindle. I loved the ideas, the mystery and the characters. Kaylee is a likable person and I'm looking forward to getting to know her better in the next book. If you want to test this series out, this novella is really a good way to do so! It will leave you hungry for more. I have a feeling I'm going to adore book one!"
1921,4,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic, with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes, but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving, dangerous, and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story ""The Love of Sports Series, Book 2""."
1922,4,"A paranormal/sci-fi erotica novella, WereSlave is a quick read that can get your blood pumping as the hero and heroine finally succumb to the mutual attraction to each other.Nayla, human queen and Mace, alpha male werewold met in unusual circumstances. As queen, she cannot get married or take a human lover, but she is allowed by tradition to take a were lover. Mace is the alpha male of his pack. He could never be tamed as a slave/lover to the Queen, but it was his heart that he had to careful about or else, Nayla would own him heart and soul if he did not take care.The story takes place in an earthlike planet where humans, vampires, witches and werewolves co-exist though not in harmony. The world building started good and the author was on her way in creating a believable imaginary world. But, somehow she did not finish. And that's why I had to take away one star from what would have been a 5 star rating.Perhaps its because this is the beginning of a series of books. Something has to be new or developed in the next books, which is a good strategy by the way. I just wanted more from Nayla and Mace who are lovable in their own right, just needed a little more fleshing out to make them unforgettable. And that goes for the world building, too."
1923,5,"I read this book in one night.  It was hot sex, threesomes and drama.  I loved the storyline and would defiantly read it again.  The ending is the best and actually had me on the edge a little.  i would defiantly read again and recommend to anyone"
1924,5,"I did not purchase these books in a bundle, however have read all of them.  I start and could not put the book down till the end.  Kava is a gifted writer with an awesome imagination.  Cornwell, Patterson, Reich, etc. fans should be instantly addicted, as I am.  Enjoy. ;o)"
1925,4,"This was an enjoyable read overall.  It's a fast paced short story, but it's not lacking in detail.  Elysie and Darien have great chemistry and their discussions are fun - particularly when they are talking about old songs and books.  I know a lot of the reviewers here felt they wanted more, but hey - it's a short story and a prequel, so enjoy it for what it is."
1926,5,I can't get enough of this type of literature. I am  56 years old this is something that I will keep doing for a long time. Maybe these old stories are something we all should get back to
1927,5,"FASCINATING FROM THE FIRST PAGE FOR THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL ROUNDED ,THE STORYLINE CREATED INTRIGUINGLY SUSPENSEFUL DEPTH,DRAMA,HUMOR AND ABSOLUTELY HOT SCENES THAT INCLUDED MENAGE PLUS MF EMOTIONALLY CHARGED SCENES.  YOU'LL BE DRAWN INTO THIS BOOK ALSO ITS CAPTIVATING CHARACTERS ARE A WONDERFUL BUILD-UP TO THE SERIES.  IT'LL LEAD YOU TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE STORY."
1928,4,Pretty good book! SUPER HOT! I had tingles throughout most of the book. I love how much action and emotion and sex is put into this story. Its relatively short but not too short. I really really enjoyed it! I'll be getting the second in this series!
1929,5,"This book changed the way I plot (and I read it AFTER publishing more than 50 novels!) I love it. I just bought a copy for an aspiring screenwriter cousin. This is my writing bible. If you're a writer, you should own this book."
1930,4,"This story, from &#34;20th Century ghosts&#34;, is a page-turner with a very satisfying conclusion.  I congratulate Joe for having separated his collection into smaller, bite-size pieces which can be consumed in a short period of time.  I look forward to reading more of the stand-alone stories from this collection.I would highly recommend this 33 page read to horror readers who might enjoy a well written story told in one of the unique voices in the genre!"
1931,3,Fast paced action drawing readers in and holding nothing back could have been a little bit longer towards the end
1932,5,"Vegas Showgirl Murders by Bob Moats is another classic. I've been hooked on his Murder series since the Classmate Murders. In this book, writer/private dick Jim Richards is back in the Sin City where murder surrounds her and Penny is abducted. Without giving away any spoilers, Jim finds himself in a ""grave"" situation while bleeding from a gunshot. This was an intense book, with its usual dab of humor. Excellent read. Highly recommended. 5 Stars."
1933,5,"I've bought all of Frank Tuttle's previous Markhat the Finder offerings, as well as Wistrel Compleat, and enjoyed them all. Hold the Dark is definitely the longest and most enjoyable of the three Markhat stories.  I added the ""sort of"" qualifier in the review title because it ticks me off when publishers (I assume they make this decision) add excerpts from other works at the end of a Kindle edition.  Since Kindle edition works have no page numbers, readers use a percentage display to gauge how much of a work they've read.  Hold the Dark ends at 89% of the Kindle document and the last 11% is excerpts from the other two Markhat works, which is ridiculous because they are really just short stories, and from a work by some other author presumably from the same publisher.I realize that printed novels have also started appending excerpts but with a printed work you can find out easily see that excerpts are there and determine on what page the book will actually end. This is not so easy to do when reading a Kindle edition which for me meant an unpleasant surprise when the book prematurely ended with me wanting more Markhat.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Frank Tuttle's writing and the especially the Markhat character and would buy another one sight unseen.  Several new and possibly recurring characters are developed in Hold the Dark which hopefully will find their way into future Markhat works.  I won't add spoilers about the plot but will suffice to say it is a page-turner.  I suppose Hold the Dark stands alone but readers would probably find it more satisfying if they read the two previous Markhat short stories first.Frank, if you're reading this, and I suspect you are given that you reviewed one of your other Markhat books yourself, please get your publisher to cease and desist or at least put a disclaimer at the beginning of future works warning Kindle readers that excerpts are at the end.  Down with excerpts I say!"
1934,4,"Part of a series - I would recommend reading in orderThis book based the relationship between the H and h more on sex than anything else.  It was an important part of the story for the whole series, but not my favorite book."
1935,4,"This was actually an interesting book, filled with all sorts of adventure, violence, and intrigue.  I wasn't sure in the very beginning if this would be a book I would like, so I was surprised when I got drawn in.  An American, Eric, gets himself in a jam in Mexico and is forced to get involved in drug smuggling.  He uses his wits to stay alive and to eventually double cross his captors.  There were certainly some areas where I had to suspend reality, but I was willing to do so.The main characters were surprisingly well developed and there was certainly a new surprise around every corner.  Since I am not that well informed about the drug cartels in Mexico, I had to accept the things that happened in the book as being probable.  Based on what I do know, I suspect this was not too far off.The psychological effects of the whole experience on Eric are interesting just on their own.  How would a person react to such a circumstance?  It seems believable that he would go nearly crazy, having to be surrounded by so much violence, much of it of his own doing.Surprisingly good book.  I received a free copy in exchange for doing a review."
1936,5,"i have to say, id never read any of biance d'arc's books before, this was recommended to me and im so glad it was, a brilliant story with characters, you'll fall in love with.this is the first book in the series, and after reading this book i went out and bought the rest of the books"
1937,4,"I loved this book. I felt like I was 11 again. Wonderful plot, incredible chararacter, great morals, a very pleasant read. My boys are a little young for it right now, but I look forward to having them snuggle up under some blanket while I read this to them. Thank you Mrs. Evans for the incredible story."
1938,3,"This is book 2 of a four piece set although it could probably be read as a standalone as it doesn't really follow on from the previous book apart from the main character, Argus, who doesn't really remember much anyway!I can honestly say that these books aren't really having much of an impact although I will read the last two just because I'm like that! All I can say is that for 0.00 over at Amazon currently, why not download them and see for yourselves."
1939,4,"Wade Peterson wanted Jessica Evans with a passion and lust he had never known.  He had always been the one that just wanted to have fun, but things were different with Jessie.  He wanted to possess her, and make her his - his alone.  He was tired of sharing her with her with their childhood friend Clancy, and doing everything her way by her rules.  At Christmas he had made the colossal mistake of proposing which sent her running.  Wade knew she cared about him more than she was willing to admit, so he would just ease her into their relationship slowly to give her the time she needed to get used to it.Jessie had made a pact with her best pal Clancy when they were kids to never marry.  They had both had abysmal childhoods, and had plans to never repeat what they went thru.  She was terrified because Wade brought out feelings in her she had never experienced, and was afraid of.  Clancy knew she loved Wade, and even though it broke his heart, he pushed her where she was afraid to go.  Directly into Wade's loving arms.Wade never dreamed that their life could be so good.  He finally had the woman he had wanted for all time, and she was all his.  While Jessie was still a little new at loving and having a family, he could tell she was born to be part of his large family.  When her horrible for an excuse father showed up on her doorstep, and dumped his small daughter Shelby on them, he knew immediately she was meant to have a family of her own.  Just when they thought everything they ever wanted was in their grasp, Jessie's father showed up threatening to take Shelby away along with Jessie's heart.Jessie had never allowed herself to believe in anything permanent because in her experience it always fell apart, and so she never gave love or family a chance.  Wade helped her to see what was possible if you allowed love to touch your heart.  While the encounters between Wade, Clancy, and Jessie were hot, you always knew where Jessie's heart belonged.  This story has many touching moments, but yet some very steamy scenes.  Good balanced delivery!"
1940,5,"Certainly one of Verne's best books. It has a believable plot, realistic characters, and some advanced theories some of which have been proved true."
1941,5,"Just when I thought Not in Kansas was good. She had to take the hunky Wizard from the first book. Dump him right smack in the middle of California with a woman named Dorothy. A shy, curvy, and push over female that also happens to be a witch. A very powerful witch that is also the soul mate to said hot `Wizard of Oz'. After a fantastic `light bondage' (no ropes, think invisible bondage Wizard of Oz style) the Wizard is summoned back to Oz, and leaves our poor Dorothy with a way into Oz if she should need to come to him.This story was laced with hot erotic scenes and was even better than Not in Kansas. It added in more elements of the original story, you get a takes of Glinda, some `flying monkeys', and other mystical creatures that all over sexed and aren't ashamed of it. Let me tell you, if I had known that Oz was the land of sex, I would have hopped on the first Twister and taken my happy butt there a long time ago.I think this story had more of a pleasing effect on me because of the light bondage and spanking that was in it. This was one of the most pleasing erotic romances I have read in a very long time. The fantasy was great, the storyline was new and fresh, and I wish she would write just ONE MORE in this series so I can sit back and indulge in another trip to the land of Oz.Review also found at: [...]"
1942,4,"I was surprised.  For a short book, the story was easy to follow and didn't jump around.I will be checking out more from Elle Kennedy."
1943,3,"Not a bad book, but too long and drawn-out. The character development of some characters was fabulous while others not so much. It was a very odd mix. I did like the story and the writing. The author has definitely got some talent, but I felt it could use a little red pen love from an editor.The character I most enjoyed was Kelly, but I thought she kind of became minimized towards the end, whereas I really expected to her to have a larger part in the ending.If you like Stephen King and have a Kindle, grab this one, it's not all that expensive and is a good read."
1944,4,"This was a super quick book. I wish it would have been longer. Really liked the characters. Very sexy bedroom, pool table sex. This is a good author."
1945,3,"Pretty well crafted story. Ok characters but seemed a little short on development. Irritating poor punctuation and holy cow doesn't  this guy know how to use a period?  I kept wanting to correct things.  Good editor would have fixed it, & it would be worth it."
1946,3,"Why didn't I think of this approach when I was in college? Good Sex but lacking a bit on plot. I thought the hot jock sex made for some ""interesting"" nighttime reading, but that's about it..."
1947,3,Enough Good News was a o.k.read for me. I just couldn't get into the book. I kept putting it down I finally finished it I will not be reading book 2.I will attempt to other books by this author..
1948,4,I enjoy western  with mystery and romance! This was very good story about times gone by. I love that kind of story!
1949,5,"Although this was a short story it was jam packed with a very well written story with a great characters! I gotta admit though, I'm very intrigued about another character, Andre. Hopefully the author writes a story involving him in the near future. Great story and very worth the money!"
1950,5,Very nice reference.  Is helpful if you are looking to learn the best way to make knots and their different applications in real world situations.
1951,3,This is a fun book but no great shakes.  It is what it is and Cassidy has a nice easy style.  I read it in a sitting not because I couldn't put it down but I was in the mood to be entertained.  It does this and I will certainly try some of her other books but this one fun but I repeat no great shakes.
1952,3,"A meteor containing alien life forms hits the small, rural town of Peculiar, MO.  A few Peculiar inhabitants begin experiencing strange dreams and visions.  Animals begin acting wildly.  The lives of several Peculiar residents are linked together in this suspenseful, science fiction novel.I enjoyed this novel because it was suspenseful in parts, had well developed characters and was very well written.For the most part, the book was suspenseful and a page turner.  I had to get to the next page, chapter and definitely had to find out how it all ended!  However, there were some scenes that I felt were too long or drawn out.  This took away from some of the scenes.  I especially felt this way near the end of the book where I think it was filled with too much description.  I felt it was slower-paced with lots of explanation that was not necessary.  That being said, I want to reiterate that there was good suspense and at no point did I want to stop reading or skip to the end.I felt the book was a bit gory.  I expected a science fiction novel but this was a hybrid - mostly science fiction with a few pages of gore.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and I wouldn't take off any stars, but it's just good for a reader to know.  It's now tagged as ""horror"" as well and I think that tag wasn't there when I purchased the book.I was a little disappointed with Rachel's storyline.  I wanted to know more about her link to the unspeakable crime in the past.  Without giving anything away here, I suppose I expected more resolution on that side story regarding said crime.The characters were great.  I felt connected to all of them and I could empathize with them.  I cared about what happened to them and wanted to see how the story turned out for each and every one of them.  I enjoyed being on an adventure with these characters.  I'd go on another one with them.  I think I would have liked to see Gordon more developed but maybe that was the point - he was supposed to be a bit mysterious.  I enjoyed (for the most part) the character of Rollins.  He was a bit uneven but I liked that.  I liked how the point of view changed.  It wasn't hard to follow and the reader gets to experience the storylines of the different characters.There was a lot of science in the book.  I have no idea if it was accurate or not but there was a lot of scientific description that was way over my head.  Thankfully one of the characters felt the same way :-) so another character regularly  explained the science behind the aliens.  However, it was still a lot for my taste.  All in all, I found the book to be very well written.  Robert Williams is a very talented author and I plan to see what else he has written."

Kallyten pens an erotic story with a twist that should warm your soul and there is a BONUS story!!"
1954,5,"This story was a rather good novella/short story.  It gives you just enough of a taste to be ready for the final book entitled ""The Darkness"".  It follows up on some of the things from the last book entitled ""The Fury"" and I liked that about it.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that, even if it's a short story/novella.  This one has details you must read, in my opinion, to get the fullest possible picture of what's going on and what's likely to come afterward.  Have at it!  You won't be disappointed.  I don't get the bad reviews of this one, personally.  I enjoyed it."
1955,4,"A secret combined with political power equals a man held in an asylum with no reason to be there. This book goes beyond first impressions; never judge a book by its cover plays a huge role in this story. It was a little cliche how all the brothers met up in the end, but who doesn't like a happy ending!?"
1956,4,this was a good read.  I will even go so far as to say I will read it again when some time down the road. I will also seek out other books by this author.
1957,5,I am a new Kindle user and downloaded my first issue of Reader's digest and was simply delighted with it!  I read it from cover to cover over a few days time which I have never done in the hard copy of the magazine.  I love that there are no ads and found it easy to navigate between the articles and features.  Thanks Kindle and Reader's digest!Its a few months later and I am updating that I still LOVE this magazine in Kindle format. I have seen a few people complain about not getting their back issues but I have no trouble at all with it. I had been off for a few weeks and when I returned I went to my Manage my Kindle on Amazon and there was a down arrow where I could select which issue I wanted to download so I selected both I had not read and voila! Both are on my Kindle now for me to read.  No problems at all.  Enjoy the magazine!
1958,4,Nice enjoyable read. The mystery was fun to unfold and the characters likable. Will definitely read another Henry Wright Mystery when I get the chance.
1959,5,"Rafe and Emma forever, I luved this book so much and wish i could read more of those two. Sad that book was too short, but i guess oh well!!! Was happy that it was the best ever after for the both of them!!!"
1960,4,I enjoy Beth Kery's work...I wasn't sure where it was leading me at the beginning but was well worth the reading to get there.  Very steamy!
1961,5,"This author has quickly become one of my favorites!  Her books are well written, with good character development and lots of steamy love scenes!This book is shorter than her other books, but it definitely keeps you entertained the whole way through.  I'm looking forward to her next novel!"
1962,5,This is a very good book. I got it this morning and just finished it. Once I started reading I just could not put it down. Well written with plenty of action. Nice to have an older hero wth vices of trying to quit smoking and holding his temper in control. Neither of which he does very well. There are other reviews that tell you about the main character and plot both of which are very good. I just warn you not to start the book at bedtime as you are sure to lose sleep because you can't put it down.
1963,2,"The plot of the story was very promising.  The first several chapters kept me interested and I couldn't wait to see what happened.  But that was where the problem lie.  I felt like a waited and waited and waited to see what would happen.  About half way through the book the dialogue became utterly boring and I didn't think I would ever reach the end. When I did reach the end, I felt let down. The grammar was pretty bad so if you are not able to overlook errors you might not want to even try this one."
1964,4,"This book offers a lot! It is funny, serious, and at times sad.  But the author really does a great job joining all of the characters into the forefront.  You should read the first two that come before it so you don't miss anything and you will have a much better understanding of what is going on with this ""Monster"".  I really enjoyed the way the characters were brought to life and the consistency in the story line.  Good job Ms. Dubois!"
1965,2,Trite and repetitive - why do gay novels generally tend to be little more than a series of strung togther sex scenes with little narrative content ad even less literary value.  Come on guys we deserve better than this.  The theme of issues of being openly gay in sport is raised but the the novel closes before the consequences of being out are seen and the story developed.  Mills and Boon for gay men with sex included!  An hour's read at best with little characterisation or story outside the sex scenes.
1966,2,First of many possible books.. Told from the make point of veiw.  But also a finding lost love story.  Not terrible
1967,5,"The story keeps getting better and better.Let me tell you... Jacob is so swoon worthy! I love every single thing he says and does. I love how he's settled at Vic's place and the little differences in the apartment now that he's there. I love that he's so understanding and patient. I love that he keeps olive oil in the kitchen *sigh*In this installment, Vic's life is happening as he tries to solve a mystery. We see something new and completely creepy, creepier than crisscross. A new kind of evil that animates corpses. Very intense and scary.At the same time, him and Jacob are in the hunt for a new place to live.The coolest thing about Vic is that he is hysterical without even trying. Even something as mundane as eating a hotdog turns Vic into a clown in the best possible way. I adore him!We see a little more of Jackie the ghost, I love her too!And this is the first time I read exactly what Vic's Job is all about. Seeing him working, talking to the dead is so awe inspiring. He is funny and badass all at the same time."
1968,4,This was a wonderful continuation of the fabulous lotto love story. Haven't we all locked eyes with someone on stage somewhere and taken this journey in our imagination at one point in our lives? This story brings that fantasy to life quite well! Great Job!
1969,5,"I was a little thrown by the review that called the vamps lovey and introspective. However, I decided to give it a try and really enjoyed this book. The main character is tough girl familiar with the streets who is believable. So many authors try for tough and fail, but this character rings true. The vampire mythology is well thought out and there is plenty of blood and violence. Yes, there is a bit of love but it fits in well. This is definitely not a vampire romance novel. Some books I say not bad for the price. For this book I would say worth every penny at full price."
1970,2,"The Bell family was haunted by a ghost who could argue a biblical verse, sing hymns, or belliger a family member until they went running from the house!  Written as a collection of individual interviews, various family members and friends talk about their experiences with the witch/ghost.  The writing is old fashioned and difficult to read.  The story itself is difficult to believe and modern readers should know they spend more time discussing the biblical discussions than the scary part of a haunting."
1971,5,"Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends, werewolves, vampires, the like, as beings of an alternate dimension. Gates allow them passage to out world. Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down, building such as Stonehenge, the Indian mounds of the Americas, and other such structures around the world. But as humans spread and built, those impediments were destroyed, weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world. In their own dimension, they are far down the food chain. In our world, they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing, cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests, cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains, there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families, the Masons, from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event, and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent."
1972,3,"This book was well written and the scenes were hot...I loved the back story, it was detailed and believable.  However, this was way way way too short!  I would gladly read something by this author again. The kindle edition was a very good value."
1973,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I feel that the idea of the book was a good one (what would survival after a catastrophic event look like).However I felt the characters were not appropriate for the adversity and the challenging experiences that the author wanted to explore.Let me say that I felt there was a fair amount of thought put into the steps needed to have the characters survive. This was a strong plus towards making the in the book creditable, if not for the characters ages.I liked that the book took place over two and a half year time frame, giving opportunities for us (the reader) to see how the characters lives might unfold and what other issues would come up.What I did not like about the book can be narrowed down to two things.One (and this was the biggest) was that the age of the characters was simply too young to cover the issues that the author was trying to tackle, making it all seem less believable.For example our main character 'Chief' Mike. At age 13 and a half, he takes on the role of leader for the surviving teenagers. The concerns and decisions that he comes up with are far greater then what a 13 year old would come up with. Even given that he might be more 'mature' emotionally then others his age, however there is no explanation as to 'Why' he would be more mature in his understanding of life and leadership. Without this explanation, his 'judgements' and 'rules' do not sit right with reality. I am left to say, ""That's pretty wise for an early teenager, and where is his teen emotions?""I could do this same break down with the remaining characters, but you can get the idea with this one and I shouldn't go on and on about that.The next issue that I have with the book is that often the mini-crises in the story do not flow with the over all story. They seem to be cut and pasted into the storyline. It would have been more realistic to have less events play out then to have the extra mini-crises.For example the whole lodge situation, it was announced, then left until the last part of the book to be hastily played out. I felt it was poorly played out leaving me feeling flat about its resolution.So what do I think of the story and do I recommend it?I think it is worth the read, but one should have low expectations, just as you would for a 'made for T.V.' movie as opposed to a 'made for the theater' movie. If you lower your expectations you probably will enjoy this book. Because I actually did enjoy it once I finally decided just to let the 'issues' be and imagine the characters say five years older (each).Due to some of the content (rape, murder and violence) within the book, I would recommend it to readers above the age of 16.I would like to see other works by this author, as I enjoyed the storyline, and feel that maybe in time the author will improve his craft."
1974,2,"Carstairs doesn't really appear much.  Okay story, but only one interesting character, and the hero shot him and his dogs.  Still, enough potential that I may try one more.No woman sleuths here.  hard boiled short story mystery are appropriate terms"
1975,1,"I don't mind buying a book....but when one is offered free...it should clearly state that it's just a preview or lead in.  This was VERY frustrating and has put me off Pinter.  I've bought a few of his books...got one free....and thought I was going to read a prequel to buy another. I would have brought it, now I feel taken. Plus you CANT EVEN BUY THIS ONE.....it's a trick."
1976,5,"I loved this book!  Korey Mae Johnson really hit the nail on the head with ""Pursuit of Glory.""Renny is a strong willed, emotional, and intelligent teenager living in a time of revolution and sexual inequality. She was raised by her father to be as quick and nimble as a man, but living in a society that believes that women are ornamental at best, she is never really able to showcase her talents. Renny flees from her father's home and discipline after he chastises her for being too blunt in front of the king. Little did she know that her escape would mark the beginning (instead of the end) of bare bottom spankings!My only criticism of Johnson's book involves the science fiction part of the story. Renny, like her father and his rival Logan, is an immortal. Her father and Logan drank from some sort of fountain of youth when they found themselves on a deserted island over 80 years ago. This fountain gave them and all of their offspring immortality. Personally, I am not a huge fan of science fiction and found its introduction into the story superfluous. That said, I don't think it detracted from the story, I just don't think it helped it either.""Pursuit of Glory"" is a well written book that would stand nicely on its own without a single spank. The spanking scenes are not forced; a scene isn't constructed solely for the purpose of ending in a spanking. Allowing the spanking scenes to be a natural part of the story makes for a great spanking novel! Korey Mae Johnson wrote a gripping story about a smart, witty, and bratty young girl who sparks a revolution and manages to make a difference, even though she ends up with a smarting bottom more than once in the process. I highly recommend this book!!Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview"
1977,3,"This is actually a prequel to the Out of Uniform Series, I think it does not show as the first book because its just a bit shorter than the other books, and was probably a part of summer reads. This is a short novella. But I consider it the first book of the series.Shelby and Garrett have become friends during the past year but only because Garrett has ignored Shelby's overtures for more. Garrett is crazy for Shelby but thinks she is too proper to consider him as a partner...Shelby overhears Garrett's friend describe her as vanilla and immediately challenges the two of them to a menage...I thought the book omitted a lot of opportunity to develop the characters but you only have so much time in roughly 1500 lines. Jumping from flirting to a menage was a bit of a stretch and I have to suspend reality to think for one moment that it wouldn't break up a good friendship - but this is fiction so go with it.If you are looking for exciting SEAL action like Suzanne Brockmann - forget it. This is not that kind of book. If you're reading for pure entertainment and you don't mind a lot of sex, this is for you. The SEALs are all good friends and buddies but you don't see much military action at all. If you read more of the books you will hear more about the characters from previous books.The storyline is good, the story is good but don't make it more than what it is. I've read the following books and have enjoyed them because they are quick and funny. Yes, I will read more Elle Kennedy books."
1978,5,Book seven by Lora Leigh  was a very good book all of my friends abound read it  they need to read the whole series
1979,4,This was a good book...sexy and steamy in all the right places.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 was it felt like it ended too soon.  Maybe I was just enjoying it so much I didn't want it to end.
1980,5,"Will, an overly-ambitious magazine writer, and his publisher concoct a scheme, frame the writer for a murder he didn't commit and hold back the evidence that will eventually exonerate him.  Will objects to the death penalty, some of his reasons very personal.  This should make his point to the public and maybe win him a Pulitzer Prize.  Brilliant idea, right?On its' face the premise seems farfetched, but as I came to understand Will and his motivations I bought into it.  I've read that any fiction requires the reader to ""suspend disbelief"" at some point.  I anticipated this would be tough.  Turns out I was wrong.But, as with any book of this type, things are not as they seem.  Some characters have motivations that aren't as they first appear.  When the plan starts falling apart those who seemed allies sometimes aren't.  Your perceived enemies might really be your best friends.  Those who should want the truth uncovered might not, those who don't, maybe do.  Hopefully, in the end, Will can survive, but will the price be too high?"
1981,4,"The story is set in Montana,and the characters are all intertwined with other books in this series. I like that. You get a feel for the people you have read about. I think each book is better than the last.  Good reading."
1982,4,"This is an interesting story, with some fun twists and unexpected turns.  It all ties up nicely at the end and left me satisfied.  There are some misused words and faulty punctuation--could have benefited from one more editing, but overall, a fun read.  Nothing heavy or profound, but entertaining."
1983,4,"Very enjoyable.  The  story start s off with a twist. The plot changes and you will constantly be  trying to figure out who is is the villain. A good love story, too."
1984,5,"I have had this book in my archives for so long but never read it until recently. I am a fan of Lena Matthews, interracial stories, the passionate lovemaking, and some of the drama that goes along with intteracial relationship. This book was an easy read."
1985,5,"Maya Banks is one of my favorite authors and Stay With Me does not disappoint.  This menage story begins with the trio already together and living their lives as a family.  Logan and Rhys are married to Catherine.  They are hard workers and devoted to their growing sucessfull business, but this is the reason that their wife Catherine is unhappy.  It seems the guys have been so single-minded in their pursuit of success that they have been neglecting poor Catherine.  On their anniversary she plans a romantic dinner at a restaurant so that she can tell them that she is pregant with their child.  They guys get caught up in a business problem and forget the dinner date.  They have to fly out to solve the problem and also cancel a planned Jamaican vacation with Catherine.  This is the last straw for Catherine and she heads to Jamaica without them.  When they discover that she isn't waiting for them at home, they realize just how much they have hurt her and fly to Jamaica to try to win her back.  This was a very romantic menage story.  The guys are hot and the reader realizes that they work hard for Catherine because the three began their lives together very humbly.  Catherine makes them realize that nothing is as important as their relationship together.  The changes they make to their workaholic lifestyles reveal the extent of their love for Catherine and results in a very touching, and sexy story.  Well done from Ms. Banks, as usual!"
1986,4,"The main story is about Jek and Brynda, but several side stories are happening which will be continued in the next books.  In this story, Jek finds his Sacred Mate Brynda who is a librarian in Texas.  She has cancer and expects to die within the year.  Jek takes her and they visit two planets on their way to his home.  They visit Wassa where men have gills and live both underwater and above water.  All females are slaves to the men on this planet.

1987,3,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y26XYE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgIs this collection worth reading and worth buying for your children? Yes.Is it appropriate for home school as a textbook? No.Is it appropriate as supplemental reading? Yes.Are the Tom Swift, Jr., books that follow the main collection worth reading? No. No. Nonononono. I couldn't get through a single one of the books without dozing off. There is too much science--a very early use of computers, but Tom still uses a slide rule--too much bad science, and too little personality. The characters are totally wooden, and in the original series, although the characters tend to be repetitive, they are fairly realistic as characters.Would today's teenager, totally used to all the miracle inventions, be impressed by these books? Would he or she enjoy them? Maybe, but only if the teenager can accept last century's stereotypes without becoming offended.My husband is just enough younger than I am that he remembers enjoying the Tom Swift Jr. books. I never saw them. What I read was my father's original Tom Swift books, scrounged from my grandparents' attic. I remember having to explain word usage to my brother, when he was complaining that they blamed everything on the confederates, and had to be told the difference between Confederates and confederates.Not only did I thoroughly enjoy reading these books, which included a number of Tom Swift's I'd never seen before, but in fact--with 52 more years behind me and a Ph.D. in English--I found them much better than I had thought they were when I was in high school.There were at least two writers in the first series, with a third who showed up near the end. One of the writers never did any research, and invented entire cities in major countries out of his head. He had a fight between a lion and a tiger in India and had a fight between two tigers in Africa--in the SAME BOOK. The second did very heavy research and the difference shows; although at times he becomes rather pedantic, in general the research is well used.I can't possibly give this more than a 3 rating, largely because of those horrible Tom Swift Jr. books but partly because some of the plots were reused in a very short series, and one got very tired of childhood feuds being carried on into adulthood. Also, continuing to call Tom a ""boy"" when the chronology of the series makes it clear that he must by now be in his early twenties and being idiotically coy about Tom's courtship make for painful reading even for a teenager."
1988,4,"I would recommend this book as a well written erotica about a threesome, involving emotional commitment between two men and a woman. I liked all three of the characters, although they did seem incompletely characterized, but that could just be me, wanting a longer and more satisfying read, when I am really liking a story. Delilah Devlin writes good western stories about romance and they are usually hot, but this one was a scorcher and a keeper to read again."
1989,5,A good review and Beginning to the three volume work of art. This is chock full of good information about the Indigneous peoples of the Americas!
1990,4,Good plot. Strong characters.A natural flow to the story that made it hard to put down. Read it in a day.
1991,5,A great story that I found very hard to put down.  Full of emotions and the ever present growing pains of pre-teens.
1992,5,"If you like to walk on the wild side of  Enjoyment with the others you will definitely enjoy the playfulness of the weres in her new book ""Inferno""...There are so many turns in this story andnew plots to encourage more stories...I can't wait to see what comes next!!!"
1993,4,"Chloe works for a software firm in a job thats going nowhere dispite her being so talented.She goes to a bar to ponder her situation over lots of vodka and winds up having a one night stand with the man of her dreams ( literally).She is totally shocked when her one night stand turns out to be Sean Keller, the man who is taking over the company she works for.I liked the story all the way until almost the end of the book.I was okay with Chloe being so weak for Sean.But I felt she let him off the hook and took him back wayyy to easy. And he really did her wrong.he should have had to suffer a little more.Over all its a pretty decent story."
1994,5,Markhat is just a fun universe. I like the main character and the easy way I could slip into that universe and not miss a beat.
1995,4,"Intriguing start to a series about a once-burned, highly sexed woman who has the good fortune, after a year of abstinence, to meet a hot, considerate dominant man."
1996,5,This is yet another  L'Amour winner. I have yet to read a book of his that was less than great. He has the ability to keep you enthalled enough in the story to make you not want to put the book down until it is finished.
1997,3,"This is a short fantastical story about writing (specifically the need to write) and what makes life &#34;real.&#34;  I enjoyed it, but something about the timeline felt &#34;off&#34; to me -- the way the author compressed this specific life into a short story felt rushed, especially with the too-frequent &#34;chapter&#34; breaks."
1998,5,Each and every one of these stories keeps you on the edge of your seat! I like series that intertwine all of the characters from the previous books so there is continuity and history to draw from. I love the strong female characters and how love conquers in the end. Lots of sizzle if you are into that sort of thing.
1999,3,"At the time that I write this review, there are currently 14 other reviews all with 5 stars.  I am giving this 3 stars because I didn't find anything truly outstanding about this book.Most of the stort stories are in a first-person point-of-view, as told by Adam.  However, there are a few that are not and I found that confusing.  Also, there is one story (Michigan) in which the narrator refers to himself as Noah.  Who is Noah?  Later in another story, when Adam speaks of losing his grandmother, I can only assume that it was Adam at the hosptial/nursing home.  Why he said his name was Noah, I still do not know.The final issue I have with the book is that some of the sentences I had to read over and over again.  They were phrased so strangely that they barely made sense.  I could have though of many other ways to have written those sentences and I am by no means a writer.The collection of stories all and all were good, not great.  The bottomline is: I wasn't hooked and I did not feel the urge to read every chance I got, as I do with REALLY good books."
2000,5,"OMG, I loved this cute love story.  It was adventure, family, rivalry, romance and just plain cute.  I loved the set of the story during the Holiday Season, it gave it a wonderful back drop for the romance and the ending to a loving family entertainment with a twist of romance to keep the intrigue. It definitely made me want to continue to read."
2001,4,"This whole ""instantly recognizing your mate"" thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth ""shifting"" when emotions run high, very cool!! If you like the genre, you'll like this: family, loyalty, friends, and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action, and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not, if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it."
2002,5,"A good page turner mystery.  Can't give it away as the ending may surprise you.  I liked it very much, and I did not guess the &#34;bad guy&#34; until the end.  In fact the end will surprise you in any event.If you like mystery and suspense, this one is for you."
2003,4,"This book is short, a cute story with a predictable ending but still enjoyable.  For American readers, the titles of all the medical personnel in England can be a bit confusing, but not enough to spoil the story line.  If you want a story you can read in one afternoon and enjoy it, even though you already guess the ending, I recommend this book."
2004,2,"First of all the back description throws you off a bit and the book went in another direction I didnt expect which was a disappointment. Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war, he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation (plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he'll be an Earl due to an inheritance). So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father, he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children. They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness (Yea, I wasnt buying that). During the next few weeks, St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home. I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away (but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero's protest, at some point you need to get some back bone. Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father. And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste. I skimmed alot so I cannot in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset. And I was left wondering whatever happened to the children of the duke? why bring them in the tale if you hardly mention them? The hero/heroine were likeable but not enough to save this book."
2005,5,This book was a hot read! This author knows how to tell a story so that you feel like you are right there!!
2006,3,"This wasn't a bad read but I have a few buts. Ty and Gwen were good together and the sex was good don't get me wrong but the writing stlye confused me. Ty and Gwen met discussing the book next thing I know their kissing and having sex I had to go back a page or too because I thought I miss something, it's like it went A to M instead of A to B it wasn't only the sex it was other things. I don't mind the bondage but it wasn't believable to me that Ty and Gwen were trying to write a script  based off her book about sex/ bondage and Ty think it's going to be a movie that people will take him seriously in Hollywood.I know when to releax and not read too much into fiction because when I read I want to be taken away beyond the norm. And getLost  in a book no matter how bizzard the plot, but this book it was a split it in the middle for me. The sex and the little things were ok but the story line kind of jump around a bit**********************"
2007,5,"I really enjoyed the book, in fact once I started reading could not put the book down at times you wanted to say to the sheik stop being so dense, but the ending was great."
2008,5,"I liked this title for two reasons. It moved quickly story-wise and the paranormal element. The characters could have used a bit more fleshing out. But for as novella, it was a good read."
2009,5,Nice little read if you've got an hour to spare. Joe Hill carries on the horror writing tradition of his father in a stupendous way.
2010,5,"Emma Carter, co-owner of Wallflowers, has been in love with Max Cannon since grade school and is pretty sure he'll never be interested in her wholesome good looks. Boy, was she wrong. Max overhears her voice while at his friend Simon's and is can't believe that the sexy voice making joking innuendos with his Beta and ordering him around is shy Emma Carter. Determined to discover if Emma lives up to her voice, Max gets Simon to bring him along when he drops off his new masterpiece at Wallflowers.After getting fed up with his ex Livia chasing him all around town, Emma is a breath of fresh air with a delightful sense of humor and oh, yeah, there is just one little thing... she's also his Mate. Max is the Alpha Were-Puma of the local Pride. He breaks it to her quite soon and she takes it with surprising aplomb before he takes her home and promptly divests her of her virginity. Add in best friends who love each other, but won't admit it, ex's who won't give up, and a masquerade where Emma must prove her power as the Curana before the Pride or forever be looked down upon and you have delightful romp of a romance that is just plain fun to read.I really enjoyed this tale by Dana Marie Bell, the characters were interesting and well written for a shorter story and the explanation of the Were-Pumas was short and sweet which I great appreciated because it let the culture have an active part in the romance without making it the milestone to be crossed as it is portrayed in so many paranormal stories. I also greatly enjoyed the detail applied to aspects of the characters personalities (like the photos on the mantle), that say much of a person without having to spell it out for the reader and the humor which left me snorting in my seat (kitty litter? Priceless)."
2011,4,"This is the first in a series that I believe at this point is up to about nine titles.  As you'd expect, this one is only the beginning and I'm looking forward to the rest of the &#34;Chapters&#34; in the near future.  The writing is simple and a very fast read.  I find myself almost believing it might be true.  I mean, who of us liked to get up early and go to bed early as youngsters.  Bring it on Ethan!"
2012,5,"Wow! This is one story that I didn't think I'd ever see written and Ms. Pierce did an excellent job at it. What happens when you are wolf, cougar, and human? Jayda is all three and her needs seem to be being met with Cole who is the wolf that has been with her for a while helping her until a particular cougar named Zane comes along as the new game warden. Chemistry is pulling them together and it's undeniable. But when a cougar is found dead, Jayda and Zane go on a mission to find the cubs and passion ignites. He is going to wake something in her that hasn't shown itself until she's with him. But who can she be with? Does Cole meet her needs or does Zane? Will she be able to decide who she wants to be with? With Cole being the Chief of Police and Zane as the game warden, they all will have to work together to find out what is killing the cougars. Is that going to even be possible?"
2013,5,"I recieved this book in exchange for a honest reviewThis was a hot short quick read, things move fairly quickly and while not everything was resolved it was still a great enjoyable read, i look forward to reading the next one and see how these characters develop together. Lisa and Leo with there past, Lisa and Brett and there current relationship."
2014,3,The book started out a little slow for me. It did get better as a read. It was well written with a good storyline.
2015,5,"This is a touching story of a little girl who changes her destiny to become a lady knight. This is one thing that is unheard of, and I praised Nicole for writing an excellent story which pulled me from the start.Throughout the story I could tell the author did her research thoroughly.  Strong characters paved the way from the start to the end. I always considered historic fiction to be boring, but Nicole has changed my mind.  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
2016,5,I first read the Reaper when it was a freebie through my cruz.  Then paid for it again on Kendle only to find out it was the 5th book in a series.  I LOVED the reaper.  And My Soul to Lose is another page turner and I couldn't put it down.  This is a Teen series but it doesn't matter your age as I am 51 and read it on hubbies Kindle and LOVED IT.  Next one is My Soul to Take.
2017,5,Lora Leigh's books always deliver an erotic dance of passion and defiance in a quest to deliver their characters hearts.
2018,4,I just wish it were longer. It was a cute erotic romance. I am a huge fan a menage best friend romances. I Love how well the characters fit together. It was a great read. Good Job Mari Carr

Angel breaks down the door and sees Cara Michaels in all her glory. After rescuing her, Angel plans to ravish her!Merciful Angel is very hot. Angel is an intense lover. He's dominant and a little rough; he's very sexy and Cara is a siren with a hint of innocence. Angel's attributes plus the fact that he and Cara have such an intense sexual encounter so quickly make Merciful Angel unrealistic, but it's a scorching hot fantasy!NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
2020,5,"This was a good Highland series book, I enjoyed it very much and you will also,Just a fun read."
2021,4,"From the first page this story is gripping with a strong heroine, a psycho serial killer and a British accent.  The plot was full of twists and turns around every corner keeping the reader enthralled in the mystery and anticipation of catching the killer.  For a serial killer mystery this author is able to present a unique and entertaining take.The characters of Payce and Gavin are flawed giving them a plausible background story making them believable.  Their hardheaded dedication is a trait to be admired and it makes them inspired even more to catch the killer.I was provided a copy of the book by BTS eMag for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review - all conclusions are my own responsibility."
2022,1,"I will read almost anything.  I like romance, erotica, thrillers, humor.  This book wants to be erotic but really it's just sex and the sex isn't that interesting after awhile.  There is no character development, the plot is more than simplistic.Basically, the guy goes into the Tyger version of a heat.  He needs sex and he needs it now.  The spacecraft needs him to pilot so they ask for a volunteer.  A female Tyger from his planet volunteers.So they have sex, domineering sex that gets old after the first two times. He treats her like convenience.  She resents him but wants him. And could the character please stop saying the word pussy. The pun was old after the first 10 times.  The guy gets well enough to pilot, his heat ends, he dumps her, she is broken-hearted.He ends up missing her after all and decides to take her back.  She says yes. The end.Really.  No plot.No depth of character.The male character is unlikable.So that's what I have to say.  This one is a not worth the three dollars.If you like these types of books, read Lora Leigh's Mercury's War, Megan's Mark, Dawn's Reckoning.  Those three are much better than this one.  Want something with more humor?  Read  'When He Was Bad' or 'The Beast In Him' or any of the series by Shelly Laurenston.You want something with more edge?  Read about the Sazi series by C.T. Adams.But don't read this."
2023,5,"This story is a thrill ride set in the past and present. The characters are rich and engaging, and the plot is chilling and mysterious. Trust me, you've never encountered vampires like this before.Heather combines history and fantasy in a way I've never encountered. She boldly merges biblical stories with her own brand of adventure in a truly spellbinding story of family, love, and redemption.There is no possible way to describe the depth and intrigue of this novel in a short summary. You must read this story to truly be rewarded! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, action, and is fascinated with modern interpretations of the past."
2024,5,"This started off a little...haphazardly.  I wasn't sure of some of the phrasing and even had to read a line or two twice.  But the characters were very interesting, and the plot was quite intriguing.  The flow evened out perfectly and the first story was satisfying--I should have known, as is the case with a truly talented storyteller--this book would only get better.  Each story has its own flow--beginning, middle, end, and the book as a whole also has some great character growth. This isn't so much a collection of short stories as it is a set of adventures involving two (or more) great and funny characters.  There's wit, danger, intelligence--and most of all, Fun.  I loved it."
2025,5,"Book Title: The Classmate MurdersAuthor: Bob MoatsPublisher: Magic1 ProductionASIN: B002D48NBOReviewed by Michele Tater for The Coach Tater ReviewMiddle age is when your old classmates are so gray and wrinkled and bald they don't recognize you. ~Bennett CerfJim Richards a sixty year old who lives with his parents and recently has lost his job as a security guard for a car dealership. He is an avid reader of reading and watching anything related to mystery; books, movies and television series. The book ""The Classmate Murders"" follows this older in body than mind, gentleman who leads a simple and somewhat boring life until he receives a disturbing e-mail from a high school classmate. She was actually an ex-girlfriend of his who was now afraid that someone wanted to take her life. Unfortunately, he receives that message too late and she is found dead with the message that there will be more murders to come. With his good friend Buck, Jim decides to use his learned investigation skills, no matter how limited, to try to solve the mystery before others are found dead. With team works so well together that the police seem to be one step behind them. Jim becomes an important part of the case, even with small matter he knows a little too much about the woman involved. He comes the conclusion that the women being threatened are cheerleaders from his high school. Who would want these women dead after forty years later and why.I must admit I didn't think that a story about a senior citizen wanna-be private investigator was going to be so entertaining, but was I wrong. This book proves that even an old dog can have a sharp mind to look at details and figure out leads to solve a difficult case.  With its  humor, and friendly banter between characters and with some steamy sexy scenes, this book packs a lot between its covers. Adults of any age would find the characters likable, the plot integrating, and will find it a great mystery. I liken it to a cup of tea brewed, not too hot and not too cold, sweet with a little honey with no need for the cream."
2026,4,"I tee-heed, chuckled and laughed out loud at the antics in Naughty or Nice. A real romance comedy! What a delightful movie it would be."
2027,3,"Jace Rankin may be short, but he's nothing to mess with, as the man who was just hauled out of the saloon by the undertaker knows now. He's a famous bounty hunter in Oregon in the 1890s who, when he shot the man in the saloon, just finished a years long quest to avenge his sister's murder and is now trying to figure out what to do next. When the snotty-nosed farm boy he just rescued from a gang of bullies offers him money to kill a man who forced him off his ranch, he reluctantly agrees to bring the man to justice, but not to kill him outright. But, first he needs to tell his sister's widower the news.Kyla ""Kyle"" Springer Bailey has been riding the trails and sleeping on the ground for the past month while trying to find Jace. She wants revenge on the man who killed her husband and took her ranch, amongst other crimes, and she's not so keen on the detour Jace wants to take. But she realizes she's out of options, so she hides behind her boy persona as best she can and tries to keep pace. When a confrontation along the way gets her shot and Jace discovers that Kyle's a Kyla, she has to come clean about the *whole* reason she needs this scoundrel dead and hope he'll still help her.The book has its share of touching moments and slow-blooming romance. Kyla, we find out, has good reason to fear men and hide behind a boy's persona. Watching Jace slowly pull her out of that shell and help her conquer her fears was endearing. Her pain was real and deeply-rooted and didn't just disappear in the face of his sexiness. Neither did his understandable aversion to marriage magically disappear after a round of nookie. Why would a man who's drifted from town to town for his entire adult life - a man who's killed his fair share of men along the way - feel he'd make a good husband or father? They're both the walking wounded and in a unique position to help each other, they just need time to realize it.However, while it was packed to bursting with my favorite themes - Old West setting, a heroine passing as male, a morally ambiguous hero, wounded souls, road romance, the kitchen sink - there was a certain...distance in the writing that kept me from getting carried away. Both characters were distinct and fully-formed and I couldn't point to any glaring instances of bland telling or anything, I just never felt really invested. I enjoyed it quite a bit, as it was an exciting trip, but I was watching them from far away. I definitely wasn't on the run alongside them. Add on a hasty and too tidy ending, and the book left me feeling a bit less than completely satisfied.I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it was above average. I'd still read another book by the author.Note: I read the re-released ebook version and noticed there were a lot of formatting errors and missing words. I had to mentally edit as I read for some sentences to make sense. It wasn't too too bad, but it was a little distracting."
2028,5,"Oh, Jodi Redford, you always know how to give a girl what she wants. And by that, of course, I mean that her characters are put into both sexy and harrowing situations and they respond with snark and shenanigans. As it turns out, I like ALL THOSE THINGS!Mara and Dash are combustible. In a big way. He's got the sex fae thing going for him, she has wide-eyed naivete coupled with a bouncy hair and a knockout body that distracts Dash at every turn. Quite frankly, the two of them together works for me. The snark! The quips! The HAWT kisses! *swoon*Beside the sexy times, Dash's thievery skills have landed him in some hot water. Not because he's bad but because his reputation is JUST THAT GOOD. Mara's quick mind is able to keep up with him (he finds that sex-ay, btw) and she's driven to succeed in the quest that's been set before them.Quite frankly, all of Jodi Redford's books leave me giddy with delight and this one was no different. The sex fae have a certain something that makes them FUN to read. The humans might be considered lower class citizens in this world, but they can hold their own against those they're pitted against!ROCK ON, HUMANS!-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal"
2029,4,"Regrettably, I downloaded this book before looking at the string of reviews and comments associated with this publications.  It is a pity that there is copyright infringement and that corporations like Amazon have gotten into bed with companies that promote piracy.  With that said, I must admit that I enjoyed the book.  I am a long time fan of Poul Andersons &#8216;Time Patrol&#8217; series and his novella &#8220;High Crusades&#8221;.  When I saw this book listed in Kindle format, I jumped for it.  While the stories are slightly dated, they are still enjoyable to read and are interesting.  I highly recommend if you can find a legitimate copy of any of these stories, download it and read it.  I&#8217;m certain that you will enjoy it.As an aside, I went looking for &#8220;Call me Joe&#8221; as another review had mentioned it, and as that reviewer stated they couldn&#8217;t find it in Kindle format.  Well as I say, I went looking for it as well and had no success.  There was a second hand paperback version for $32.00 but no e-copy on Amazon."
2030,5,"Like a modern Lord of the Flies.  Very good story, keeps you riveted waiting for the next challenge or threat.  Modern kids with modern ideas, forced to survive the unknown.  A good read"
2031,4,"One of the classics by the science fiction master HG Wells, it reads just as well today as it ever did.  Recommended."
2032,3,"This is a fantasy about space going fairies. Maeve has a bounty hunter after her, his name is Coldhand. No-one on Maeve's ship knows who or why there is a bounty on this lovely creature. This books has a well developed plot, however the author gets very wordy in descriptions."
2033,4,"I was happy to read this new-to-me author on the recommendation of my ammy buddy. Really the best way to get a rec! I loved this story as a space saga, definitely a slow building romance to me. Although there was a lot of sex in this book, it did not add to the story much because it was repetitive and seemed almost mechanical. I was intrigued by the world-building and all the different aliens and their strengths and weaknesses. I loved that the book was long, but I also got the sense that it was a bit dragged out when new things kept popping up in the story, all of a sudden there's a drug that can kill and an antidote that can bring the same alien back to life, all of a sudden there is an introduction to some alien spiritual level of existence, it seemed to carry on too much by that time. I loved the character of Xenos, he shone bright blue of course, above all the others in this book, I loved when he spoke with Moonlight or anyone else in the book, everyone else just had to step up and deal with whatever he said because that was who he was. Loved it! I was so curious I even read the short story Kate Hill has on her website about the Yule season, very amusing! All in all, a great read and I am grateful to have been introduced a new author who writes good space romance."
2034,4,"Worth a reread.  I absolutely love Ally Blue. I've read almost all her stories and The Happy Onion is just as good as her other books.  She can put it all into a story...humor, great sex, and a believable story.  Recommended."
2035,4,This book was an okay read.  I had to refresh my memory about what the book was about since it has been awhile since i read it.  I hated the way the hero treated the heroine in the beginning and how he let his mom treat her as well.  Overall the book was pretty good and the ending was of course good.
2036,5,"This was a beautiful story Bout love the second time round.  Despite the separation and the secrets,'ll e won out."
2037,4,if you're looking for a little more porn than your normal everyday Regency lovestory than this is the book for you. It is very sexy it is compelling and it certainly was very different from the books that I normally read. I can't wait to read the sequel.
2038,5,"Alice, who is 12, finds herself changing, then finds herself accepted into the prestigious Nocturnal Academy. Turns out she's actually becoming a vampire, and the school is for creatures of various sorts.She's also the victim of bullying and it continues to get worse. Her father is living with his girlfriend. A girlfriend who just happens to have opened a gate into the Immaterium, a place of very evil creatures.So Alice has to adapting to her changes, deal with her father's evil girlfriend, and stop a full-scale invasion of the Earth by creatures from the evil dimension while, at the same time, avoid being killed by the bullies who have becoming increasingly violent. It all makes for an extremely good read."
2039,2,"I normally try and give a book a chance regardless of the reviews.*****To the AUTHORI appreciate the hard work that you must have put into  this book but I believe it could be more way more. I know the book wasn't free and the authors takes a chance when they put their books on the free listing more readers, more reviews and more brutal honesty.******To The READERJust within the first chapter that alone tells you how this story is going to be and it's  not so good. Sydney and Jason just even reading them being intimate wasn't good. Basically within the first chapter I felt you read the beginning, middle and the end if that's even possible. Sometimes reading these paranormal romance (vampire, werewolve and immortals lately are becoming water down and it's just finding the right author, storyline with romance and a little action and excitement to keep your interest throughout a book. Dare I say this but maybe with more help and this was a short novella this could have been a good story"
2040,2,This is the second book I read about this author. I stopped reading this book at chapter 2. The only thing I found interesting about this book was how the baby lost his parents. Other than that the book was boring and I found it too dry and lost interest. I liked the first book I read by this author better than this one.
2041,1,I love this authors work usually but this semi religious  and weird view of life made me sad and confused as how the same chap could write such different booksit  went on my delete list
2042,3,"I enjoyed the other tales in this series a  bit more.This one was a bit to raw for my taste.I must add though that seeing this couple end up together made a lot of sense since it was established that they had such a long history to their relationship.  The way they finally end up together, while &#34;so high school&#34;, was comical and let's just admit it, really could work in real life."
2043,4,A bit surprising. If sex offends you don't read this book.  It is filled with it.  Right from the first few pages.  Good story.  I would like to see the Author come out with more in this series.
2044,3,PROJECT ALPHA- a  good read - has lots of action and hot sex! Left me wanting to read more about project alpha members - since this is one there must be more-
2045,2,"I thought I was going to find some new information about early Christians.  This book is really a summary of their beliefs, so I didn't find anything new."
2046,5,"Detective Chandra Hunt's best friend Valerie has been missing for months.  A strange tip leads her to an adult club called Foreplay, where she first encounters the charismatic vampire, Sin-Bad Stoner.  Chandra falls for Sin-Bad's badness, bait, hook, line and sinker.  When she arrives at his home and meets his equally stunning brothers, the rest of Sin's plan explodes into full affect.Sin-Bad has been searching for someone like Chandra for centuries after losing the woman he loved.  Chandra is strong-willed and independent, challenging him at every turn.  After sharing one passionate night where all their carnal desires are fulfilled, it is all the confirmation that he needs.  But first, she must be willing to yield everything to him, including her freedom.Night of Sin blazed off the pages until I just knew I was going blind from the heat glare.  There is no getting around the graphically sexual language, descriptions, and encounters between Mega-Alpha Sin and his obsession, Chandra.  This is a tale of sheer dominance that is mental, emotional and physical on the most primal level.Sin-Bad is so ruthlessly domineering that he sometimes scared me, very much like an adrenaline shot.  Ms. Lee's writing was quite effective in projecting what it means to have a Dom on this level seize complete control of his woman.  Chandra fought but she never stood a chance from the word go.That's not to say there's no substance here, au contraire.  The dialogue between Sin-Bad and Chandra is movie quality, and carries the weight of some interesting psychological truths about the relationship dynamic between men and women, vampires and humans.I'm shying away from revealing a few interesting plot twists, which makes it worth the read.  Night of Sin rocked my world, set my retinas afire, and made me wonder just what it would be like to be in Chandra's place for a night or far, far longer.Patrice F.Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
2047,5,Fast paced novel that keeps you reading to the end as fast as you can.  The book also makes you aware that maybe a big brother could be created.
2048,1,"I didn't finish this book, and that is incredibly rare for me. Like, I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book.Firstly, as a native Irish speaker, it kind of annoyed me to see Irish words thrown into this book. It just suggested a laziness to me. Using Irish words is fine if there's a reason for it, if your book features Irish legends, or characters, but this book has no ties to Ireland at all, so it was just a convenient way for the author to avoid having to create a language.Anyway, the reasons I didn't finish this;It's incredibly confusing. Most of the time I had no idea what was happening, but that was OK, because very little happened. I gave up a little over a quarter into the book, and the main character had been assigned to work as the doctor on a pleasure ship, had a few run-ins with the staff, and that's it.The main character has no redeeming features at all. She comes across as arrogant, holier-than-thou and self-important. She didn't entice me to keep reading at all.The main male character similarly, is flat and uninteresting. He used to be one of the most elite fighters in the universe, now he serves as the captain of a 'floating brothel' because his mother, the queen, is punishing him for refusing to marry. He is arrogant, rude, and while I'm sure he's stunningly attractive, there is no physical description of him, the ship, the universe. There is no world-building.This book is meant to be erotica, and to be fair, I gave up before there was a real sex scene, but I wasn't holding out much hope that they would be hot, given that two references to a man's penis were made, using the word 'dangly'. We're all grown-ups here, surely. It's a penis"
2049,4,"Nice pace, story moves well. Some unexpected twists keep it interesting. Echos of Robert B. Parker with a slightly bumbling hero."

2052,5,"Wow! out of the chute action, romance and one Hot Outlaw named Cal Ryker!***************This is a follow up from RIDING WEST (believe me when I say it means Celia was ""hehehe...riding Parker West!""..not the compas direction..) I suggest ya'all read that one first!Cal is one dreamy Cowboy, with a quick draw and a reputation that sets the other 6 members of the train robbing gang to thinking twice before denying his offer to trade his share of the take for the woman they took hostage. Cal's original plan to just keep Laurel safe until he can return her to her family, goes awry when they find themselves alone for 2 weeks!.......(2 steamy weeks)What starts out as a hasty rescue winds up as more of a heartfelt romantic tale complete with smart, sassy and sexy dialogue as only Emma can conjur. This is one short tale that packs alot of romantic pillow talk and honest character development that will make you ""sigh"" and beg Emma for more, more, more of those West/Evans's stories."
2053,2,didn't like him. barely liked her. no sympathy for either character...plot totally undeveloped...just scene after smut after scene.  DO NOT waste your money!
2054,3,"""Angel Be Good"" is a modern day take on ""A Christmas Carol."" The two main characters, Nat and Daphne, spend the night reviewing Nat's life and working on changing his attitude toward the world. I really like Daphne. The author spent time and effort developing her character. But it didn't seem as much effort was put into Nat. His character facilitated too often to make him believable. Like any ""Christmas Carol"" story, you want to see the person come to a epiphany that changes their character and makes the world a better place. This story reached that point a little too easily and a little too dramatically -- You need a kidney? Here take one of mine.Overall, it was an easy story to read, get into, and stay in, despite a few minor shortcomings."
2055,5,"The 2 month free trial is well worth a try.  I'll say that up front.Second, NYT is a great paper.  I haven't gotten newspapers in a while, due wanting to cut down on the amount of trash I generate, and because I got tired of excessive advertising.  Blah, blah, blah .... now that I'm getting NYT as a wake up each morning, I'm remembering what I was missing.I'm spending 20 minutes per morning reading through the parts I find interesting.  It's good stuff.  I'll probably continue after the trial is over.That said, I agree that that price is a tad high.  I'd be much more comfortable with less than $20 per month, considering how much is stripped out.Also... someone at NYT should read these before they go out.  The Bridge column last week made numerous references to the missing diagram.  I can understand leaving out some pictures, but vital pictures should never be left out.  If you're going to leave out pictures, I think all the static Op-ed pictures can be left out.  The bridge column without diagrams is pointless, so it should be added to items to strip out -- or to include diagrams with.Good science section so far.  I miss the crossword.  Even if the crossword wasn't interactive, I'd love to see it.  I have some grid paper.NYT is really close here, I think, so with a little more care, they could have something less frustrating to send out.----------------------I've decided to continue subscribing.  I've been reading NYT in bed before getting up for awhile now, and it's a great way to start the day.  I'd still like for it to be better, but reading the newspaper in bed in the early morning is a new joy I don't want to give up."
2056,4,"Oh, I liked this one! It was fast paced and the romance wasn't dainty or slow but, with the history between Atlas and Nike, it worked. Plus, I loved being able to dip my toes back in the world of Gods and Titans. Those guys are just always at each other's throats, aren't they?As it turns out, Atlas and Nike like to go for more than throats. *wink wink* Yep, those two can't seem to keep their hands to themselves. Well, they *can* keep their hands to themselves. But they don't want to. And they have the whole doomed relationship thing that puts Romeo and Juliet to shame. Those crazy kids got nothing on the war between the Greek Gods and the Titans!A nice, fun, naughty little snippet that gives hints of things to come. It also shows us how awful Cronus is to his subjects. The guy's a jerk. A big, fat jerk. I'm sure he'll get whatever's coming to him.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal"

I'm glad I didn't.The writing was a little stilted..""I feared the chocolate mustache that matched her long brown hair, but how could I resist a hug from such an eager child?""Some of the current day stories interspersed into the St. Nicholas account seemed unnecessary--ketchup on Grandma's turkey as a Jewish tradition?--and were jarring. For awhile I wondered why even bother to intersperse these stories with the historical fiction.  The last chapter helped to make sense of it.The St. Nicholas part of the story was entertaining, enlightening, and inspiring. The author managed to seamlessly include nearly every Christmas tradition as originating during this time--mistletoe, Christmas trees, etc.  It really is a Christmas story. I suggest you give it a try."
2060,3,"i disagree with the other reviews in that i liked the story and plot elements. it was a little loose in areas but in all solid. i agree that the erotica fell apart both in description and logic... leo wouldnt need to do what he did, the story didnt need it - almost like author needed to try and write this kinda scene even tho the story didnt need it or that it &#34;fit&#34;.  it didnt. i also did not like that jaden let his mate go. ending could have been infinately better and still left plenty of suspense for duncan, moira, and jaden's tale."
2061,3,"I've read a number of books by J.A.Konrath.  This is a collection of his short stories.  I would say one third were good, a third were well, not so good and the last third was filler space.  I wouldn't recommend this book."
2062,5,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing, tight plot, intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man, I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry, the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything, it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it, like a sequel)"
2063,4,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 8/10PROS:- The plot is intriguing. It took me a while to figure out what was going on at the beginning of the story, and once the story gets going, it's got a nice amount of (non-life-threatening) intrigue to it.- Oliver's circumstances are well portrayed. The author gets across not only how little he has--for a gentleman, anyway--but also how desperately he wants Vincent.- March also does a good job of showing Vincent's struggles against his desire for men as well as his yearning for his father's respect. The author also manages (in a fairly short story) to portray Vincent's possessiveness rather convincingly.- The sex scenes are pretty hot, and there's a BDSM element to them, which I didn't expect. I had no idea there were sex toys back then, but the characters sure use a lot of them.CONS:- If there's one thing I think could have been a little better developed, it's the two men's friendship (and as an extension of this, their background). I understand their sexual attraction, but the emotional connection they have was a little hard for me to buy into, given the social distance between them.- At times, I really disliked Vincent. He's arrogant and selfish, although I do understand that in a way, he can't help it. He's a product of his economic and social surroundings.- There are instances in which some sentences are hard to understand because the author uses ""he"" without telling us which character the pronoun refers to. Here's one example in which the second ""he"" ought to be ""Oliver"": ""Vincent excelled at everything he did whereas he always fell short."" There are also times when the wrong word is used in a sentence: ""...and allow Marsden's to racket [ratchet] even higher.""Overall comments: This is Regency romance without the typical tendency to hold back during sex scenes. There aren't a surplus of those scenes, but March definitely doesn't shy away from details during them. I really liked the way the characters ended up together; it's an unusual take on the typical Regency situation."
2064,4,I like the series and each book is different. I enjoy the writers style and very few writing errors. Highly recommend.
2065,5,"Not Allys' usual but she has given us one amusing, sweet, charming and light hearted romance with 2 very likable characters. A hunk who loves to bottom and a little spit-fire who tops. When these 2 come together the sex sizzles. Certain scenes are just pure fun and sexy. The dream featuring a blanket, Phil insisting Thom resembles one of his favorite carton characters (no spoiler here) have me chuckling aloud.Thom and Phil are so different in character but that is where the fun is. Phil annoying Thom because he finds a fired-up Thom so sexy is just comical. And it is nice to have the seemingly submissive Phil in their relationship so possessive and protective over Thom, who is forced to be tough throughout his life because of his smaller physique and pretty face.Of course Ally manages to inject some angsy moments into her romance too. I have a fun time reading this one and I thought Thom, who has nothing in the beginning of the story, finally finding a home with Phil is just touching."
2066,5,"Chloe Maitland is a very hard working young woman who tries desperately to save the house she inherited from her father from foreclosure. Except for the mortgage on the house, her father left her a smithy behind the house but Chloe can't work the shop by herself, neither can she find a blacksmith in the small town she has been living all her life, which is past the gold fever and in a desolate economic condition. Chloe advertised in a local paper for a blacksmith but nobody showed up since she can't offer anything else besides board and lodging.  Every day that passes increases her despair until one day a stranger arrives in her yard and breaks down  with a heat stroke - he read the add and applies for the position but right now he isn't in any position to help Chloe. Anyway, she patches him up and although she doesn't really want to hire him she sees no way out and Travis McGuire starts working for her. However, the coexistence between Travis and Chloe is anything but peaceful: she's strong-minded and bullheaded, he's insulting and relentless and the sparks fly!What a wonderful story! The plot started out a bit slow but was then elaborated into a beautiful love story that offered successful as well as entertaining twists and turns.Chloe was a wonderful heroine. Life sure wasn't nice to her and she tried to shield herself from further pain by raising an emotional wall around herself.  However, when she finally finds love she is willing to begin a new life even if this new start would offer her even less than she had until now in terms of belongings and securities.Travis was a very complex character who also suffered a lot during his life.  It was very interesting to observe that his initial ""disliking"" of Chloe's appearance and attitude changed into love and that he would have sacrificed his life for Chloe's safety. Absolutely adorable!By the way: there was a villain who was interesting  personality and somewhere a bounty hunter was involved and played a major role in the development of the plot.An absolutely recommendable book about real love and second chances in life!"
2067,5,"Love, love, love this book. The author did a wonderful job writing this story. I think the three of them are perfect together. There will be funny moments that  will make you laugh. I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already. I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author. Her latest update to this story ""ever after"" was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book. Can't wait to see Paige McKellan next book."
2068,5,"The retirement plan of the Kurev mob family is death; either naturally or by hitmen.  No one just leaves alive.  Cynthia Beller and Lee Maxwell understand that first hand as her father Claymore and Lee, accountants at the same firm working the blood money of the Kurev mob, tried to quit at different times.  Nine years ago Claymore and his family except for his daughter Cynthia were murdered; three years ago, Lee survived the hit, but his wife and daughter were killed.  Each of the survivors vowed separately vengeance.They meet for the first time as Cynthia having just finished a kill is about to leave when Lee enters the abode to assassinate the same thug.  They encounter one another twice more before agreeing they have the same list and strategic BHAG.  They agree to team up to destroy the Kurev family by dividing up the kills.  Meanwhile though sympathetic to their cause and respecting them as he loves his wife and daughter that he might seek vengeance too if they were harmed, FBI agent Owen Dunham struggles with capturing the Grudge Ninja vigilante serial killer preying on the mob.This is an exhilarating serial killer thriller that hooks the audience because the key three players seem vulnerably human with remorse, regret, and resoluteness.  The vivid story line is action-packed especially with the scenes of the kills.  However, A.J. Scudiere's tense thriller belongs to the Grudge Killer(s) and the cop reluctantly trying to bring them to the legal justice system even as he believes their vigilante justice is just.Harriet Klausner"
2069,4,"I have enjoyed the entire Supernatural Bonds series so far and this is another great addition.I personally love it when the story's main character is a dragon, not only because I love dragons but because there are so few of these out there, in terms of the entire scope if paranormal writing.As per typical, we have an Alpha dragon seeking his mate.  I loved that this particular dragon was an oldie with specific ideas on how he was going to go about claiming his human mate, only to have it all go to pot once he found her.  Living through his frustration, all while seeing his extreme enjoyment, was quite amusing.In this book, I was a bit surprised that there wasn't a super baddie to be fought off, run from, protect against, as ie usually the way. After all, a good story has to have an antagonist/adversary right?  Without giving away key aspects of the story, I will simply say that in this story, the threat was not against his mate but rather someone she cared about.  Even with that, I have to say the threat was not much & I was left somewhat disappointed in how that part of the story was handled. To me that's part of the story I usually enjoy, so having it lacking left me feeling kind of uh.For the most part I consider this a good addition to the series.  It is certainly not my favorite of the series thus far, and was more sex and ""me dragon, you mine,"" than it was an actual completely written story, but it was enjoyable.Given that the books are all character continuation (the same characters connect throughout the series in one way or another), I would recommend starting at the first book in the series.  This certainly can be read as stand-alone, but I think the entire concept will be much more thoroughly enjoyed (some of the characters, their abilities, their mates familiar) if read in reading order.I have already started the next in the series, ""Conner's Wolf,"" and I am hopeful that Jory will get back on track with a great villain, good plot and engaging story as she has thus far with the Supernatural Bonds Series.  Enjoy! :)"
2070,5,I enjoyed this book a lot .. As well as I did the 1st one.. I like all three stories and all of the MC's as well ... I loved how each story has the characters of the precious stories so all stories really flowed together.. The world the authors built was awesome as well .. Definitely recommend!!
2071,4,"I liked this story, I only wish it was longer. Hopefully the author can revisit the relationship with a sequel.I don't read menage stories that often but I do have to say that I appreciated this one for telling an entertaining from the perspective of all the characters so that you know how they were feeling and it wasn't just about sex. Also much appreciated is the twist that the exes were the two men. Most of the menages I've read, the men don't interact and are solely focused on the woman so I liked seeing the change of having the men sexing each other too."
2072,5,"Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days is well written and well researched.  It is an accurate historical account, and I recommend it."
2073,5,Top notch writing from Castillo Price as usual. There is a creepy feeling throughout the book when Vic comes out of his many years of drug haze and starts to notice things. His paranoia is based in real events but it can also cause very real problems in his personal life.
2074,3,"This was a one-time cursory look.  If one is interested only in what is going onin Washington and what is dished to the regular press, this is good to read."
2075,5,I love my Westmoreland men they are handsome and very sexy.They make me hot I just keep reading these books.
2076,1,"The species work was good and well as the emotions. However, more plot would have been nice and follow up at the HEA.Spolier!!!!!!!My main issue with the book is the fact that there were horrible rapes in the book. A barmaid who also sold sex (not the herione) was raped twice. She was gang raped the second time. There was no pleasure (no forced seduction here--which I don't like but I know some people do) however, the rape was descibed erotically. And it was not. Also, even after the herione witnessed the rapes of this woman and the woman was telling the truth about something she was doing, the heroine called her a whore. This was out of character and not to mention awful.The makings of a book book and a good writer are in here. I risked another book and the writer improves greatly but I can't recommend this book."
2077,4,"This story is about a runaway teen named Two, that ends up on the streets and has been turned into a 'working girl' to survive. Her pimp has gotten her hooked on heroine and she does as he orders for her next high. One night she is specially requested by a high paying customer. It turns out that the 'client' happens to be a vampire that has plans for her that do not include allowing her to remain in her current line of work. His plans are a little more life changing. Thereon wants to turn Two and keep her with him forever;however, his creater and master Abraham doesn't agree. Buecheler adds his own spin on the creation of vampires and their ability to remain a creature of the night. This is a good read. There are strong characters, and you may not always like the way the story goes, but it's more realistic to have some down times I suppose. There are some grammer errors, but it's not too bad for self published book. It's also free, so you can't complain. It's a full story, but it allows for a sequel, which is more than can be said for alot of the other free ebooks. Overall, it was a good read. I would recomend it to friends and it's nice to see a change on the typical vampire story line. I, for one, am waiting for the next book in what is planned to be a trilogy."
2078,5,"Third book in ""Dakota Heat Anthology"". Preceded byDakota Ranch Crude. Followed byDakota Springs. Note thatDakota Heat, Volume 2appears to contain the second two of 4, in paperback.Plot:Cowboys with A Dark Past arrive on Dakota's ranch, looking for work, but with a deep secret. Can Joe and Colt help Dakota save her ranch? Can Dakota save them?Comments:- Contemporary cowboy menage erotica.- 2870 kindle locations, 39774 words- Sex is all m/f/m - generous, loving. Not Dominant. Hot. No m/m. Some anal-play. Aiming for a committed threesome.- While this is the third book in an anthology, all books are completely independent. There is no expectation that the books be read in order, and no cross-over of characters or plot points.Opinion:Another excellent book by Ms Brooke. In ""Dakota's Cowboys"" we meet three people who need to learn to love and trust again, and together make their own HEA. Ms Brooke knows how to write a sex scene, and once again she doesn't let us down. Very hot, loving, gentle sex with men who struggled not to let the past break them and a woman who has been let down so  many times. Together they are stronger, they are more, and they are loved. A HEA we want everyone to get, and we know they will. Recommended.Aside:Different takes on how a menage develops:Her Dakota Men- pre-destined. They always knew that one day they would be together.Dakota Ranch Crude- necessity. Shayne couldn't trust himself with a woman, but when he shared he could give his all.Dakota's Cowboys- opportunity/organic. They finally found each other; they were better together.Dakota Springs- researched. This was the only way they could all be happy; they googled their way to a menage.-CR-"
2079,5,"Kindle is my best friend and this keeps my friend safe from drops and me.  My first kindle fell out of its case and broke the screen, this case is much more reliable with a secure clip that holds it in place yet gives you ease of access to key board, and sound systems"
2080,5,I have been a fan of Max Brand westerns for many years.  This is my first time to have his collected works.  I'm enjoying every story.
2081,5,"It has characters that you really understand and start to root for. there are New and interesting characters and creatures. I think the idea is really cool and I really enjoyed reading it! It was a little long, but since I have a three hour commute every day I love it! Shorter books don't do me any good! thanks for the great read!"
2082,5,"My Thoughts - 5 out of 5 unicorns - I loved it!!!**Gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewOkay first things, this is a very adult erotic short story.  It is only about 25 pages, and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some M/M/F.The cover is okay and shows the characters, but it doesn&#8217;t grab my attention.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to judge this book by its cover.Okay I loved this story, but if you aren&#8217;t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don&#8217;t read this story.  It is a quick read, but it totally had my attention.  You get glimpses into the lives of the 3 characters in this book and some background.  I&#8217;m not usually one for short stories, but Kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.I totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves Kally&#8217;s work.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more of this series in the future."
2083,1,This would be a good story to discuss in a literature class but it left me flat as a form of entertainment.
2084,3,"This wasn't a bad read but it was flat and under developed. There wasn't a strong conflict which made you anxious to turn the page. The premise of the book was that  Andreas, the H, blackmailed one of his employees, Saskia to pretend to be his fiancee so that his grandfather would not pressure him to marry his older cousin whom he really hated. Typical Harlequin plot which can still work if develop but the blackmailed centred around his accidental meeting with Saskia who was shamelessly flirting with him because she mistook him for her friend's boyfriend whose loyalty was being put to the test by Saskia and her friend.Andreas used this incident and the threat of losing her job to blackmail her to pretend to be the fiancee. This was to me a weak basis because her supervisor's report showed she was a top employee with a lot to offer the company and there was no basis to fire her. The h was compliant as she did not insist that he hear her side of the story and he and his cousin insulted her with little protest from her.Also, there could have been more interaction between H and h. There was too much narration, ie hearing what was going on in their heads but not much talking to each other. Because of this I couldn't believe that they fell in love and so quickly.I would still recommend this book but can only give it 3 stars."
2085,4,What would happen if teenagers were left on their own? This is the way the &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; should have been written.
2086,5,I didn't know that there were such books written so long ago and I'm enjoying these stories.  I hope other give them a read!
2087,4,"I really liked the start  to this series. The romance is sweet. Smexy Times hot yet tasteful. The action plentiful and butt kicking by both the H and h. They complimented each other well, perfect bond mates both alpha, no submissive for this couple. Eager to see how the next coupe match up."
2088,5,"Lora Leighs books are the best.  Anytime a new one comes out its a keeper, I love her series.  thank you"
2089,4,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.  I picked it up because it was a free read, expecting it to be at most OK, but I really enjoyed the story.  The main character is a down and out heroin addicted prostitute who falls in love with the vampire that turns her.  For me, the ending was not even close to what I thought it would be.  In some ways a bit of a let down because it didn't really end with all the good guys living happily ever after BUUUT the fact that it didn't really follow the whole "" and the two vampire lovers lived happily ever after"" format was a really nice change.As another poster mentioned, yes it could use a good editor and there's probably a few story line items in the book that could use some work.  It's not a real thought provoking work of art, but overall it was a really nice, easy read.  The author should have a second follow-up book either already out or in the works and I'll definitely look into that."
2090,4,"This book might get you started but does not go into a lot of detailed information.  But, I enjoyed the book."
2091,5,"Right off the bat I have to say the character development is epic!  My emotions were all over the place with this one.  The main characters made me angry, sad, and frustrated but yet I want them to work and be happy!  Crazy huh?  Because Kalleysten has taken the time to develop these interesting characters, it was easy to purchase the next book in the series.  (I was given a copy of Blurred Nights in exchange for an honest review.) Although I have to admit I would like to see certain characters end up together, I can't wait to see how the rest of the story is written.  This was a great start to the series although I think a prologue about vampire/human pacts would have been helpful.  After you read this one be prepared to order the next!"
2092,4,I like the idea that I can cover my kindle and put a strap to keep it closed and feel it is well protected by the cover. I'd like it better if it was made from a lighter material and didn't cost so much. That's why I gave it  a 4 star instead of a 5.
2093,4,"This is the second book in the Dragon Town Trilogy.  The first book is Snapdragon Alley and the last is Dragon Town.  In this book, Argus, the 3-year-old from the first book, is a 22 year old man with a quiet life.  He is quiet and depressed, estranged from his family, an lives with a group of roommates that he doesn't really interact with.  He doesn't remember the experiences of the summer that took place in the first book.  One day, he is handed a mysterious package.  Those around him are intrigued, and everyone joins together to try to solve the clues.The tone of the book is fairly dark, and you keep hoping for a better 'Happily ever After' for the characters from the first book than is portrayed here.  But this is only the second book in the series - perhaps there is more to come.In writing about a book series that Argus is reading, this author writes ""They were genuine mystery novels, where the mystery often remains mysterious, unlike most books of that type, which should really be called 'solution' novels because there is rarely any mystery left at the end.""  That description is certainly true of the first two books in this series.  I'm definitely left mystified and wondering.  And yet, I'm not disappointed.  I don't feel that the plot was left hanging.  And somehow, I don't think I will be disappointed even if the last book in the series leaves me with the same sense of wonder - plotting and turning around all of my different theories in my mind."
2094,3,"I felt cheated out of a chance to curl up for a couple of days with a read to keep me company for longer than an hour.  If you are not really into reading, and have to spend an hour or two on a flight, by all means, get this book.  Otherwise, spend your time elsewhere."
2095,5,"I received this book as a gift for an honest review.I couldn't put this book down! This story is about Cole and Marin.  We met Cole in Whispering Lake. He hasn't been to lucky in love. However his luck on that front maybe changing.Marin hasn't had it easy. She was in a predicament that she was having a hard time getting out of. But with her werewolf, she just might find her HEA!This story of Cole and Marin is one that I had a hard time putting down. The story line flowed. The character's emotions were felt with every word. Don't worry if you read Whispering Lake, you will still get to see Cassie and Matt! I can't wait to read the other books in this series!"
2096,5,It was a really short story but it was a really great book and I just loved it. BIANCA D`Arc did a really good job on this one.
2097,4,"This is the second book in a three part series ( as of yet), it can be read as a stand alone no problem. While it can be read on its own the others tell a bit more to their story  :)  short stories filled with lots of steamy lovin. Great for a free kindle book."
2098,4,"As posted on The Smutty Kitty4 out of 5 LicksWhen I discovered there was a book by Jayne Rylon that I hadn't read yet I knew I needed to rectify the situation immediately.  Dream Machine takes us into the world of Becca's dreams and let me tell you this woman has some sexy dreams about her boss Kurt.  Kurt and Becca make such a great couple because they each spend quite a bit of time fighting the growing love between them-one of my favorite things for characters to do is fight the attraction.  These two may be fighting the love portion of the attraction but thanks to science they are not fighting the sex portion.  lol  Thanks to Becca's wicked dream desires they have all kinds of hot kinky sex.  I'm quite happy to say we get our HEA for Kurt and Becca although the path at the end got very rocky.My favorite part about this book though was Luke.  He is one of those secondary characters that just took over for me.  When he was in the scene he had my complete attention and sometimes even when he wasn't around I was thinking about him.  I'm thrilled to say he recently got his own book,Healing Touch (Play Doctor), come back tomorrow for that review.  If you love Jayne Rylon, and quite frankly how could you not, then make sure you add this book to your collection.  This one is sure to leave you with pleasant dreams."
2099,5,I am reading one of her other series and love her. Reading her stories makes you feel you can be traditional and kinky ae same time.
2100,1,"The one and two star reviews about sum up my opinion of this book so I won't belabor the point.This is my first review and only my opinion, but I believe the author obviously is a skilled writer but this book fell flat."
2101,5,"`""Listen to me, son,"" said the caller. My father? ""Kill John Helms."" Then he hung up.'What happens when the lines between reality and delusion start to blur? Paranoid schizophrenic Argus Ward sees and hears things, but how much of it is real? What about the voices telling him to kill his most famous client...Crack-up hooked me from the start. By the end, I was almost as paranoid as Argus. A fast-paced, excellently crafted thriller, gripping from start to finish. I look forward to reading more from this author."
2102,5,"I have found the books one to four of the Guardians book by Christopher Williams- great reading, very exciting and good story - not worried about the grammer as I just enjoy the story.  I haven't finished book 4 but I'm 78% through it.  Wondering if there is a book 5?"
2103,5,"This was too cute, to know they have loved each other so long and haven't been together, makes it special."
2104,4,"Short and sweet. Kallysten sure likes to keep us guessing when it comes to her books. Just when she pulls you in and you want more more more, the story ends you are ready to grab the next one.This one is about Brett and Lisa, Lisa is a vampire and Brett is human. They have lived together and been together and run a nightclub together for the past 11 months. Brett love Lisa, that much is evident in this short story. But one night another vampire, one from Lisa's past shows up and has Brett guessing how Lisa really feels about him.Can't wait to grab the next installment of this one to see more of this lovely threesome."
2105,5,"The Iron Marshall, by Louie L`Amour is one of his best. Of course all of his are the best.Louie is a man who knew the west. His books make it possible to really feel how it was."
2106,1,"I was disappointed to find, that the plug in charger that you sent me, cannot be used in Australia, as it is not compatible with our amps. So I have paid for something I cannot use. I recommend that anyone wanting the plug, source it from an Australian retailer. That way you will get the correct one. I still have to charge my Kindle on the computer. This can be inconvenient. I went away for a long weekend, and had to drag my computer along just so I could charge my Kindle."
2107,1,I am not a fan of the Bound Hearts series..so perhaps I am not the best to review this book.  I did try two of them..but since I am a reader of romantic books...these didn't do it for me.  I don't see much romance in &#34;sharing&#34;.
2108,5,"One of my favorite authors has again given me a good read. Long lost loves reunite but, guilt keeps her from being happy until she discovers the truth.  But will he accept her a third time?  I highly recommend this novel as the twists, turns and steamy love scenes will peak all your interests.  This is a page turner.  Would love to see a sequel......Come on Beth and give us another!"
2109,3,"This was a good read.  It was funny, and actually had a plot.  It was a little too short for my liking, and the ending was another of those which seem as if the author was tired of writing it and threw the last chapters together.  BUT it's a nice short story, with a nice price tag to go with it.  Nice story if you're looking for short and sweet."
2110,5,Lincoln's LAST hours  liked this book  good quick read lots of information to be had in this quick read splendid
2111,4,I loved loved loved this book. People have secret fantasies that they're afraid to admit to their significant others- afraid that they will be judged based off of those fantasies. The author brought everything that I fantasied about to life and I'm so glad she had the guts to go for it.
2112,4,"Stan Morris hit the jackpot with his first novel. ""Surviving The Fog"" was a joy to read. Normally a book could take me a couple of weeks to read. This book took only three days. Morris grabs your imagination with this story about some stranded kids and their battle to survive.The flow of his book was awesome. You stayed on the edge of your sit waiting to find out what happened. Their were many errors thru out the book. This is to be expected with a self publish first novel. With that said Morris did a great job.Just to make it known. I did receive this ebook from they author. He did not request a review and you can easily get this book on amazon.com for free.I highly suggest all readers check this book out. Follow the adventure of Mike,John, Howard,Desi, Yuie and many more young kids as they fight to survive."
2113,3,"A bit too much sex, but I really enjoyed the story.  It's not an easy decision to come out of the closet, especially when you're already famous."
2114,4,"Plot/Storyline: 4 3/4 StarsThe clever crafting of these storylines shows an unbound imagination combined with high intelligence on the part of Mr. Tuttle. Each of the stories has a unique plot with interesting resolutions.My favorite was the first one. Having it first in the collection was a great idea as I think it did the best job of introducing the two main characters and how they played off of each other.The central theme throughout all three is basically ""Use brains, not brawn."" The author sticks to that concept in interesting ways.The sense of humor I have come to expect from Mr. Tuttle is present in each story making for a very fun read.I would have liked a little more background to better understand the vow taken by Wistril, how it was enforced, etc.Character Development: 4 StarsThere was a ""Forward"" included that introduced Wistril and his apprentice, Kern. While helpful, I have always felt that stories should speak for themselves.I didn't expect as much character development in the first two shorter works. The third one was much longer and should have given us more insight, especially into Wistril's motivations.Writing Style: 5 StarsMr. Tuttle's writing style is an absolute joy to read. His humor and vocabulary, which includes some words that won't be found in Webster's, make his work shine.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors, but not so numerous as to spoil the mood. The formatting was good except for a couple of line breaks in odd places.Rating: G for everyone"
2115,3,"I liked this story, in fact I love all of Delilah Devlin's western stories. This book has some kinky bizniz happening, my imagination is clearly limited and I love a book that goes out there, after all that is why I am not a writer myself. I love romances and this book is a short but sweet romance, I liked both the heroes and the heroine, I wish there were more to the story though. I would recommend this book."
2116,5,"Although I am a major fan of dystopic fiction, novels that deal with war and violence are an extreme turn-off.  This novel could well be the only exception to that stance. Uprising, in spite of it being an extremely bloody tale, is a very engrossing and entertaining book.The author, Justin Kemppaimen, is quite brilliant in his sci-fi depiction of Haven, the self-devised land of autocratic 'perfection'.  His characterizations are well formed and believable, his story-line is direct and fluid, his descriptions of the milieu are clear and concise and, lastly, the suspense he develops is compelling.  You will find yourself, as a reader, being led to a variety of conclusions as you read the story only to find out that the author had a completely different ending in mind. The editorial flaws are minor and the easy-flow writing style is superb."
2117,4,This one although based in a different part of the state carried the theme along and was another that held my attention all the way through.
2118,5,I am a member of the LDS church and enjoy the writings of our leader.  I enjoy reading religious books from the LDS church
2119,5,"I have to say this book is so erotic!!!I can't put into words how detailed and vivid these words are. Besides the fact that two brothers having sex with on  girl reminds me of incest though. A bit odd reading how one gets turned on by looking at his brother having sex with his girlfriend. But hey, whatever gets the juices flowing. It was a real page turner for me. I wish is was an actual novel. The scenes could have been drawn out more and the characters struggles could've been concluded. But nonetheless it was definitely worth reading!! If you're looking for a quick book  of erotica scenes depicted perfectly, than read this book!"
2120,4,Written well with characters that you grow to love and root for. Easy to enjoy.  Storyline flows well! Great author.
2121,4,I picked this book because the blurb about it intrigued me and I'd never heard of this book. So far I am more than halfway through and have been enjoying it. It's a sad book though in many ways and I'm not sure it will necessarily have a 'happy ending' but it is good nonetheless.
2122,5,I absolutley love the romance in these books. I am a huge fan of RG ALexander and for the $6 price it was worth it. If you love paranormal romance with a short cheesy story and characters you can get to easily know this one is it.  Have read the first and the second and loved them both.  Quick page turning reads.
2123,5,"In a five-star rating system, this plot deserves a six. Elisse Manheim, armed only with extreme intelligence and an extensive knowledge of Wolgang Amadeus Mozart embarks on a thrilling ride as she leads her own investigation into the murder of one of her ex-students.  With an intellect and education on Mozart to equal her own, Elisse has met her match in William Masters, a composer sequestered away in the cryptic Left Field facility that is now her new employer.Nothing is what it appears to be at Left Field, and Elisse is wise to trust no one.  But William Masters is simply too fascinating to resist.  As was this book!Tempo Rubato offers a completely different side of Mr. Carroll's talents to anyone who is already familiar with his Red Cross of Gold series.  Bravo, sir."
2124,3,"This story had a different type of twist than most in it's catagory. I liked the characters and the writing overall but it wasn't one of those books that I just can't put down. If there is a second of it's kind, I won't be running out to buy it but would read it eventually."
2125,4,I thought this book was really good even tho there is a lot of m/m scenes in it.  I liked the characters but some of the things they did our said were kind of cheesy.  Overall the book was a good read.
2126,2,"Accidentally, I ordered a Kindle version of the book.  Either the author or Amazon Kindle has dropped the last 4 chapters in the kindle verson.  This was a good book.  M. L. Rhodes, in the beginning, wrote some excellent novels, then she switched to, my personal opinion,  the ""crank out mode,"" probably due to greed, shortened her books, raised her prices.  I now refuse to read anything with her name as author."
2127,3,"3.5 StarsWhile well written, not a favorite for me...Emmy was just too much of the ""lost woman"", while some of her being lost was very understandable she was still a bit too much of a damsel in distress for me....and while there is a ""mostly"" happily ever after it is also incredibly sad, especially since it took breaking Emmy's heart and then losing their brother for Taggert and Greer to realize how wrong they were....."
2128,5,Very sexy well written story. Loved the characters and plot development. This was the first book I had read by Regina Carlysle and I will be reading more from her in the future.
2129,4,"Raeanne Thayne writes stories about Cold Creek that are always a good, quick, read.  She always has new twists and turns in her romance stories and I enjoy reading them.  Just enough drama to keep me interested."
2130,5,Kill The Story was a very good book. I thought it would go one way but it turned in another direction. This is what I like in a book: interested and could not wait to see what would happen next.I will definitely look for other books by John Luciew.
2131,1,This dictionary was great for me until a Kindle update came through and now I can't use it as the default dictionary.I'm studying Spanish and was reading quite a few Spanish books and now need a new dictionary that works. I've searched the forums and it still hasn't been fixed yet. I re-downloaded the dictionary to my Kindle from MYK account and it still failed to work.This is mostly likely Amazon's fault over Websters but still I can't recommend buying it because of Kindle updates killing book functions.
2132,5,"I am so glad I purchased this. Robyn Maxwell is deaf but doesn't let it stop her from doing the things she loves. When her brother has to cancel out his back country ski trip with her, she decides she can do it by herself.When she meets wilderness guide Keil, things start heating up. Now she has to deal with wolves, mates, and Alpha challenges.Robyn and Keil are absolutely precious together. I'm glad I ignored the three stars, and purchased it anyway. The novel was a lovely surprise, and a pleasure to read."
2133,5,These books are just wonderful. I would like to know when book 5 will be published. I am just looking forward to what happens next after everyone escapes the orges in the undergound cave.
2134,5,"London - 1867Dylan Blake has spent twelve long years in dedicated service to the Crown.  He's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates.  His father refused and Dylan's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful.  He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire.  His has very little funds, is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he's staying and his father's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry, Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman.  She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they're all far more interested in her monetary value then her.  Besides, she's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless.  There's only one man who appeals to her, Captain Dylan Blake, but he's a second son and doesn't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father's all-important annual ball.  Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late.  While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan's audacity, Natalia is intrigued.  She's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake.  Once there, Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan's choosing.  The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish.  The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he's never had any trouble charming any woman, Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he's become.  There's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down.  Dylan's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who's too smart to accept any less than all of him.  Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia's story.  Dylan's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much.  Natalia is impossible not to like - she's smart, beautiful and not at all pretentious.  I loved the emotional turmoil both characters experience throughout this storyline and especially enjoyed how Dylan learns about the family secrets his father tried so hard to keep hidden from him.  This is a wonderful tale and I highly recommend both THE WAGER and THE AMERICAN HEIRESS - trust me, you'll want to read all about Dylan's brother Michael's trials and tribulations with a very improper American woman.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"
2135,5,What a great book this one. I thoroughly enjoyed the interaction between Annabelle and Mike. A very sexy book with a very sexy couple. Recommended.
2136,5,I love Nephi. He is a young man who grows up to be a great prophet. He believed in doing what God told him to do.
2137,5,"Lorelei James wrote another passionate, hot, and fun series when she started the series with the West boys.  I really enjoy the way she writes!  I can wait for the next book in any of her cowboy series!"
2138,5,"Just finished reading the third and final book of Delver Magic.  Thoroughly enjoyed all three.  I look forward to reading more by Jeff Inlo....I see complaints about typos and proof reading, and, while there were some errors, found that it did not make the books any less readable or enjoyable.Loved the delver, loved the elves, the magicians, the dwarfs, the goblins, the serp, the river rogues, well, you get it, ALL the magical creatures.......I even thought the humans were ok!  The interaction between all the ""species"" was great.  Definitely a story well told! Thanks Jeff!!"
2139,5,"Well, I must stay that over the past several years a worrisome trend has reversed itself and we have recently been treated to a growing number of YA books that not only present a good story, but ones that are well written.  The reason for this, in my opinion, is due to the increase in quality books such as the one being reviewed here by PV Lundqvist. Readers and teachers are demanding more and they now are receiving it.  What a delightful read this one was.Young Benny (Actually, his name is Bengt, something the young lad changed to Benny on his own, as soon as he was able), wants a pet.  He will settle for a cat but what he really wants is a dog.  Benny has been blessed with, or cursed with...depending on how you want to look at it, a ""creative"" mother, ergo the name Bengt; a name that is not ordinary and common, you see.  Well anyway, on his birthday Benny indeed does receive a new pet, not a cat, not a dog, not even a cool big lizard; no, no, no...a Vietnamese Potbellied pig no less!And so we are instantly drawn into the life of Benny, a kid who wants what normal kids his age want; acceptance, making the baseball team, no hassles from bullies and of course a dog.  Like real life though, not all always turns out the way our young lad would like.  There seems to be trouble from every direction.  There is of course the acceptance factor, relationships with family members and life's lessons to be learned.This is a well told tale of growing up; of being at that very strange and difficult age when a boy is leaving childhood behind and is learning to join the adult world.  The author has skillfully woven family, school, community, friends, baseball, rivals, and of course pets into a story which is quite often full of humor, often filled with the anxieties of growing up, and above all, the lessons learned during this difficult period in the maturation process of us all. But make no mistake; not all is grim life.  This writer has a keen sense of humor and it shines through on almost ever page.Lundqvist has gotten his characters down perfectly as well as the relationship between these various characters as the story progresses...including that of the pig.  The story moves on at a very nice clip which causes the work to be a bit of a page turner in a mellow and concerned sort way.  I liked that.  I also noted that there was not one instance or incident in the book that was not completely believable.  This would also hold true for each and ever character which allows almost instant empathy on the reader's part on all fronts.  The reader will be able to absolutely identify with not only the characters but also the dilemmas and situations as they pop up in young Benny's life.Being ""officially"" retired now, I spend my days as a substitute teacher, and for the most part work with kids of middle school age; the age this young boy in this book.  It should also be noted that my wife and I were one of the first breeders of Vietnamese Potbellied Pigs in the United States and spent several years raising, training and showing these little creatures.  We have had several ""house pigs"" of our own.  I can fully attest to the fact that this author does now his middle school age children and does know his pigs!I have been preaching all my life that each of us must follow their own drummer, and if perchance some of us choose a tambourine player, well so be it; so much the better!  The author has worked in several very important lessons in this work without being preachy or overbearing in the least.  As a matter of fact, he is rather sneaky about it.Strong plot, good and believable characters, crisp prose and a story line that moves; what more could you want in a book?Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
2140,4,I like the reality that I felt  as I read this little book.  There is not much submarine detail but it feels as if it could be an exerpt from someones diary.  I especially  liked the &#34;reveal&#34; at the conclusion.
2141,3,"I enjoyed this book and there is sex in the story too.  Yes, it is short, and should be less than a dollar because of the length, but I was still a different story line. Since it was the first book in the series that I read, not sure if I would get more, unless you get more pages  for your money.  (ljb)"
2142,5,real well written book. very realistic end of the world book. love the character's. the plot flowed well. I couldn't put it down. I hope there is a sequel.
2143,5,Have read all of the Hawke series and just wish there were more of them... Hopefully Mr. Vaughan will write more of them...
2144,5,"Jet Mykles has written a wonderful addition to her Dark Elves series. Awakening contains many love stories which have no boundaries. The main plot moved at a steady pace with many twists and unexpected events occurring. There are many sub plots and characters in this story. The main characters are well developed and part of a make believe yet dark world. Jet Mykles writes about sex. The Elves race is based on sex in many forms and in many combinations. Elves are not conventional in their relationships or desires. In my opinion, Awakening is the best installment in the Dark Elves series and provides both answers to past questions and a hope for future stories.I enjoy the uniqueness of this series. It is fashioned with an artistic and sex inspired imagination including many dimensions of good and evil. The interjection of so many emotions breathes life into a world only found in Jet Mykles' stories. I not only recommend this story but highly suggest reading the previous stories in this series to see the development of other couples and characters included in Dark Elves 6: Awakening. Included in this story are Jet Mykles' signature sexual illustrations. - Michele"
2145,5,"This was an absolute gem.  I was laughing throughout the entire story.  It's a quick read, but packed full of action and comedy.  I don't know if I could have laughed that hard for much longer - the length made a good match for the tightly-packed story.  Trying to string the action and laughs out to make the story longer or trying to add more in to the story just would not have created the same punch.The action and laughs start from the very beginning.  Who would have thought that a medium would counsel sexually-frustrated ghosts so that they can transcend from the earthly realm?  Not only a fresh idea in paranormal stories, but a riot of laughs at the antics Andrews provided for the characters.Looking forward to reading the full-length novels in the Karma Consultants series."
2146,5,"If you enjoy vampires sexual 3 ways, then this is the book for u. Just wish it had more to the book. To short. But I like the idea about a vampire club."
2147,4,"You want &#34;White Guys and their Black Side-Kick Versus Weird Places&#34; type stories, here's one. I only read it because I read League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which features a far more interesting Allan Quatermain. This wasn't bad, though."
2148,5,"What can I say, I absolutely am in love with the Reapers in the Western Wind Series.  Charlotte Boyette Compo is such an imaginative and creative writer, she brings her characters and their worlds to life in a way that makes you feel like you are right there in the thick of things.  When I read her books, they invade my dreams, and not in a bad way either.  Her Reapers are extremely sexy men, but they are so much more than just man candy or your typical alpha male they have a depth of character that makes you fall in love with each and every one of them.  The Reapers all have tragic back stories that mould them into the Protectors they are now.This book was about Phelan Kiel, he is the second youngest Reaper and his transformation was  heart wrenching.  Because of his rebirth and how it comes about he is leery about loving anyone and has huge trust issues towards matters of the heart.  Lucy captures his attention though like no other person ever has and he is enraptured by her from the minute he sets his eyes on her.  Lucy has secrets though and a past she is not sure that Phelan could look past.  The chemistry between the two is just amazing and they make such an incredible couple.  What happens to Phelan at the hands of the Ceannus is brutal and gave me shivers.  What the Reapers endure at the hands of these vile creatures is unspeakable and I can&#8217;t wait until they get their due.There is a new Reaper introduced in this book and I can&#8217;t wait to read his story, he is a very interesting new character.  If Charlotte keeps his character following the same direction he is in this book then I really want to read his story!  There is of course lots of action and violence to go with the sex, and don&#8217;t forget Charlottes own brand of humor.Charlotte weaves Phelan and Lucy&#8217;s romance smoothly into an already building plot and gives the reader an unforgettable ride that you never want to get off.  To get the full effect of the story and the series, these books should be read in order. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this series and hope that you do too. Totally awesome and I would highly recommend to anyone.*free copy gifted for honest review**originally reviewed for welovekink(dot)com"
2149,5,"Many Christian authors go overboard with the sweetness, but not Linda Ford. The main characters were well-developed and I felt like I could relate to them.  Billy and Vivian seemed real, as did Mrs Black.  Highly recommended!"
2150,4,"At first glance, I almost dismissed Longclaws as a seen-it-before monster novel, derivative of that 1980's horror that filled my bookshelves long ago.  I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.  I can only hope that he has a few more tales to dust off and put out there, because I want to see what else lurks in the darkness of his brain."
2151,5,"I have loved listening to Elder Ballard's talks in General Conference for many years, so I'm sure I'll love this book.  I haven't started reading it yet, but hope to in the fairly near future."
2152,4,"I am a big fan of paranormal romance, and at this point have read hundreds of books in the genre. I struggle to find new authors and series that I haven't read yet. I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. The cover is cheesy and not representative of the book, so don't let that put you off. The style of the book reminded me of Kresley Cole, Angela Knight or Gena Showalter -- good romance, interesting characters and story that pulls you in. I loved the world building and the details around werewolf life, pack structure, etc.Hillary is attacked and raped by a crazy werewolf pack, turning her into a werewolf. She barely gets away and runs for her life. She sets up a shop in a small town well away from werewolves and works hard to move on. Four years later, she meets her first werewolf following the attack--this time a good guy--who is stunned to see her living in the town. She's a technically a rogue and should have asked permission of the regional pack to live there, but of course she doesn't know anything about werewolf laws, pack structures, etc. At first she is afraid of him, but eventually she determines he seems like a good guy. He encourages her to meet his wife and his Alpha Zach, the leader of the regional pack. When he meets with Zach to tell him about Hillary, Zach is stunned at the scent on his brother and thinks there's a good chance that she will be his mate. He is interested to learn how strong she is, and that she is likely an alpha herself. The story focuses on their relationship, her acceptance into the pack, and then working with the national council to deal with the evil pack who attacked her. A very entertaining read!In case you don't want to pay printed book pricing and don't have a Kindle, I ordered this from the publisher's web site as an ebook (PDF) for only 5.95."
2153,5,"I am 62 yrs. old and I have long since lost my Tom Swift books, these are the books that brought me into the world of reading. I don't know how long they've been out,but I was 10 or under, so they have been around 50 yrs. Now that I'm retired I really want to go back and read them again, I don't remember the individual stories only that I loved them and Tom was the beginning of thousands of books I've  read since."
2154,5,I love this series. All of them are interesting and makes me feel like the people are real and this is a town I would want to live in.
2155,5,"Others are more comprehensively detailed--A Night To Remember comes to mind--but this book, first printed in 1912, is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN.  It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers, the ship, the wreck.  It's one of the more human of accounts, and, paradoxically, one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time.  A must-have curiousity for Titanic students."
2156,5,"To be honest I'm not a big Star Wars fan. Of course I saw all 6 movies, but that's all regarding this topic. No books, short stories, nothing. But I must say this was very good and easy reading, I enjoyed whole 8 books in this series. I'm not going to write here about the story, I think the book description is enough to get a picture about this book.I was just a little bit lost when there was word about various species like houk, massassi (don't know the exact writing). Their description in the book was very brief, maybe if I would know more about SW I would be in better picture. But it's still 5 stars for me."
2157,5,"I am a fan of H. Beam Piper. Even though his books are a bit dates, they are still fun to read. I wish he was still around to write books after seeing today's technology. It is well worth the $0.99 price tag to get them in Kindle format."
2158,4,"I liked it better when it was 99cts!!  Now it is $6.95 for a single copy, and $5.95 for a month.  ??? Go figure!  I enjoy the articles and cartoons but don't find much use for what's-going-on-in NYC because Iive in GA."
2159,5,"Second Hawke series we are reading, only three quarters of the way through but just have to rate in anyway.... Love it..Looking forward to reading the other two we have loaded in the Kindle...Our first read was &#34;Ride with the devil&#34; and this one is just as good.... Keep up the good work Robert Vaughan..."
2160,4,"The first concern with the paranormal romance genre is whether it is believable enough.  Could I suspend my disbelief?  Yep.  Worked for me.  I liked haveing the bundle because I plowed through these pretty fast.  Each book centers around a man who for genetic and psychological reasons is outcast but loyal.  So... this could take place in Medieval times, a police force, or on a ranch.  The conflicts and the subtle character traits are the best part.  I also like that the danger and mystery element held up.  Sometimes its just a way to get the characters in bed.  Oh, there's that too, but the human element and the well-painted scenery makes these wolves &#34;real.&#34;"
2161,5,"Again... bad reviews based on the fact people got something for free and wanted more???. its ridiculous.This a free volume in a whole (not an entire book)And I have to say, it was spot on for me. Looking forward to reading the rest of the books as this short first has caught my interest."
2162,3,"I think this is a good start for a new author.  He should consider engaging an editor and fact checker.  His writing style moves the near-term story along at a nice pace.  Had there been fewer errors, I would have rated this as a 4 star instead. I did feel like it got bogged down in the overall story arc (start to finish), but that was as much to do with my preferences as the writer's style."
2163,5,"exciting book!  showed a lot of feelings, could be real life. most books you dont know what your in for. fact, fiction, little of both. i love a book that takes you away. this one did. i read at least a half a book a day and still work. love books this is a great one!"
2164,5,I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a suspense filled mystery that keeps you interested from start to finish. My favourite  books are ones that keep me so engrossed I want to know more about the characters on the last page of the book and this was certainly one of those!
2165,4,"great pulp fiction.  enjoyable, fun read.  reminds me of the old detective magazines no longer in print.  well written, good descriptive passages.  definately not a book or even a novella - more a long short story - but  still worth the read."
2166,4,"My Lady Compelled is the first book in The Archangels series. It's a series of 6 erotic historical romance books that take place in the Regency era. The Archangels group consist of 6 men who helped England by spying on the French.The book starts off with Lord St. John having a ""wives sale"". His wife, Lady Gabriella St. John is barren and he sees no need to have her anymore as his wife. Lord Drummond Penhurst, the Duke of Kitteridge hears of this sale and names his price. Lord Drummond has always been attracted to Lady Gabriella. He thinks by taking her as his wife he can teach her how to pleasure a man properly. Little does he know Lady Gabriella has never seen a man naked or what to do with one even though she's been married for 25 years. Lord Drummond wins the sale and starts his mission off by pleasuring Lady Gabriella three times. Lady Gabriella is in shambles after that. She has never felt or experienced anything so unbelievable in her life. She figures since she was bought and paid for that she now needs to do what he said, especially after he brought her to climax and donned her in diamonds.If you want a fast historical very erotic read, then this book is for you. The story line wasn't that strong but that didn't bother me while reading this book. I wanted a hot steamy erotic romance and that is exactly what I got. I did enjoy it and I plan to read the rest.[...]"
2167,3,Fun short story...I'm a great fan of both these authors and would love to see them write a full length novel together...gave it 3 stars just because it was such a short story...
2168,4,"Title:  Primal AttractionSeries:  Pendragon Gargoyles Book #2Author:  Sydney SomersRating:  BReview:  While this one was another great addition to the series, I didn't like it quite as much as the first one.  It almost had a different tone than the last one, I guess because Cale and Sorcha have all this past history with each other.  I did get a bit frustrated with Sorcha at times, because she refused to admit how much Cale meant to her.  She was so set on being a huntress, it was like she couldn't see the forest for all the trees.  She was a tough huntress though and an interesting character.  Of course, Cale made up for her stubbornness with his determination to win her over.  His sheer happiness that she has really come back from the dead - at least from his perspective - is so sweet and touching.  However, it was kind of sad though that she would never regain those memories that she once had had with him.The story was still original and in line with Sydney Somer's writings though, and I find myself once again looking forward to her next book![...]"
2169,5,"Becoming Miss Becky was just as great at the first book in this series, Taming Eliza Jane.  Miss Becky arrives in a small western Texas town, but she doesn't quite understand what her dead Aunt willed to her!  When she finds out it's an ill-repute business that the town folk call the ""Chicken Coop"" she is more than surprised!  While trying to run this ""business"" she is also trying to find herself.  Not only does she figure out who she is as a woman, but she also discovers the Sheriff.  He's scary and willing to shoot anyone that looks at him the wrong way or calls his horse ugly, but he can't seem to get enough of Rebecca Hamilton.Another great book by Shannon Stacey that will make it hard to put the book down!"
2170,5,Another great read from Bob Mayer in the same tradition of his series I found to be good reads with plenty of action and suspense
2171,4,Author keeps you looking for the next chapter. Suspensefull.  Will read more from this author. A 4+ rating. Almost a five.
2172,5,"Loved the story. so glad she kicked her cousin out, would recommend this or any of Ms Vaughns books always  are great read."
2173,2,"The second book in the Bound Hearts series was not as good as the first. The lead male is once again a dominate sexy male who know what he wants. James wanted Ella even when she was married to another man. Ella is a shy woman who has a hard time dealing with the fact that she wants kinky sex. Ella lets James stay in her house and they start to have a sexual relationship. James pushes Ella to come out of her shell and divulge her fantasies. The sex scenes are smoldering and very detailed. I just didn't like the female lead, I thought that she sounded that a harpy. I also thought that she was a hypocrite; in the first book she is awful to her daughter because of Tess's sexual preferences. Yet she turns around and starts practicing them herself. I just couldn't get past that."
2174,3,"I wouldn't say that Crystal Jordan's ""Treasured"" is a spanking novel.  I would say that this book is an erotic novel containing a lot of sex with a spanking or two thrown in for good measure.  That said I still really enjoyed this book.  The focus may not have been on spanking, but it was still a hot read.Becca was the perfect protagonist.  She was strong, independent, and could sword fight better than a man.  But when she and James were together, she was completely submissive.  Her loyalty to James was both sexy and endearing.If you are looking for a steamy novel to read, this one is perfect for you.  It is well written and keeps the reader engaged.  I only wish it had a few more spankings amidst all the spicy sex.Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview"
2175,3,The CHRISTMAS VILLAGE MIRACLE by Teresa Lily is a sweet Christian romance about the power of prayer to change your life. Jane's life is hard and tedious. Her dreams of living in a small New England town and being a librarian seem hopeless until she sees a Christmas Village in a shop window. Ron longs to find someone to share his life with. When Jane drops her coin purse Ron feels compelled to follow her to return it. Both find their way into the shop and through prayer and a touch of heavenly magic discover that dreams and longings can be fulfilled.
2176,5,I love Gena Showalter books. Even her short stories display her rich imagination and keeps you craving for more.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good read.
2177,5,"Book 1 is set on Earth after years of subtle take over by an alien race.  It delivers the back story while developing the characters of the two main protagonists Nick Tanner and CJ Montgomery, building them so that you can easily step into their point of view.  Mrs. Delaney has accomplished a remarkable move here in balancing between the two and the story is quite enjoyable.  I look forward to the next installment"
2178,4,"I'll admit that I struggled through the beginning of teh book. This is probably why I am not the biggest fan of backstory's in a book. It ends up being a boring information dump. But it was a dump that Lena Matthews quickly dug herself out of it. What I do like about this story is that Shane and Paige have a believable chemistry. I am a firm believer in no relationship do-overs but after reading this story, there might be an upside to second chances."
2179,3,"First off, I just read above where this story had been re-edited in 2011. If so, why was the revised edition not put on Amazon? This story was truly hard to get through, mainly because I had to keep going back and re-reading many, many sentences because they were huge run on sentences and did not make sense the first time I read them. Secondly, comma or no comma? They were everywhere, almost like the author threw darts at his manuscript and wherever the darts landed is where he put them.The concept of the story itself was interesting, sort of. I just don't know really what to do with this story. I love to re-read my zombie books, but this one you couldn't pay me to even glance at, mainly because it took so darn long to slog through it because of the wordiness and the errors. I gave it 3 stars because it was an original idea, and didn't want to be mean."
2180,5,"Benjamin Button's personality in the book is a bit different than the movie, but a memorable character nonetheless. &#34;Other Tales&#34; are must-reads for Fitzgerald fans."
2181,5,This book was emotional with lots of great sex. The love between the couple even with ALL of their differences and to bring in another into the relationship could definitely complicate. The instant attraction and hot vampire sex.Awesome!! Definitely read if you are looking for a quick sexy read!
2182,5,"Sacred Fate (Chronicles of Ylandre, Book 1)Rohyr Essendri is a high-born True Bloods; ruler and a skilled warrior who defends the realm of Ylandre, however he always displays integrity and respect for others, even the family members he is not fond of.Lassen Idana is lower-ranked Half Bloods, taken from his small town and converted into Rohyr's paramour. With his calming personality and dignity, he earns the respect of most people.The citizens of Tal Ereq seldom received visits by high-ranking dignitaries, yet their appeal for help brought a delegation including Rohyr, the sovereign ruler of the land. Rohyr is drawn to Lassen and a connection is formed between them with only one look. Desire soon develops into a lifetime of love so strong nothing can break the bond, not even Rohyr's forced political marriage to another.Sacred Fate is a captivating and distinctive story of a dual-gendered world. The setting is an all-embracing environment of a magical medieval era with fiefs, swords and war steeds, only this is a world of men who can re-produce. The well written plot is enthralling. Each character inspires interest in their connection and personality. While there are few love scenes, they are incredibly sensuous. Eresse creates the social atmosphere with illustrations of prejudice which facilitate rejoinders like ""Lassen had little regard for folk who were so full of themselves, they could belittle others on the basis of their perceived inequality""; a realistic sentiment and mirror image of today's culture. Sacred Fate is an outstanding fantasy that I thoroughly enjoyed."
2183,3,It was an okay book. At times too much Sicilian tactics for me. The story was just okay. I might read the next story to see how the characters develop.
2184,5,i truly enjoyed this book. evie knows how to build then release sexual tension. if you are in need of a pleasant quicky you will enjoy this book.
2185,5,I liked it. I thought it was well done and way ahead of its time. Kind of neat someone coming up with stuff before it was invented.
2186,1,"His 'guardian' never did. The whole book seemed like an after thought.  Jackson had an idea for a story, but came up short, way short."
2187,4,"I haven`t read much sci-fi, but I know I want to read more after having smiled my way through this short, but very interesting story. The story was set in an intriguing world and I loved how it was told. The emotions of the hero and heroine weren`t overdone but told in a rather dry language that fit them - and the world they live in - perfectly.I must admit that I immediately bought the second book in this series and hope it`s as good as the first one :-)"
2188,5,"Although this book is short, I give it a high marking because this author is able to do something other authors aren't...tell a compelling story in a short amount of space. This was the first book by Lissa Matthews that I've read and I thought it was well done. The characters were compelling and determined to follow their own life paths. Bailey is particularly interesting to me...a submissive capable of taking care of herself and taking ownership of her sexuality. Something not often seen in books with female submissives. Yes she likes to surrender control to a Dom in the bedroom, but she's not willing to surrender her independence. I think the fact that she sticks to her goals is the one thing Aidn most admires about her...but that's my interpretation of the story.Even with the ambiguous ending, the author has made it very clear that Bailey isn't willing to settle for less than everything from Aidn which allows my imagination to explore all the wonderful possibilities in this couple's future. With luck, Ms. Matthews will bring Bailey and Aidn out in other books so readers can get a peek at how their relationship is going.A quick read, but well worth the money."
2189,4,All of the books by Cliff Black have been great! I've read them and wish there were more! Good job. Write some more Soon!
2190,4,"Great premise for a good steamy read. It could have been a little longer giving a little room for some more character development and interaction but it wasn't incredibly short either. Definitely a book more dedicated to the spicy sex than true relationship building (that's really just brushed over in a few sentences...""and when they weren't screwing each other's brains out they would laugh and talk..."" sort of deal). However the author created an interesting world that I wouldn't mind reading more about."
2191,4,Save the world...This is the story of Count who has been gifted a magical shield in order that he can save humankind.  The various characters throughout the book are all well done.  My only complaint was the various time jumps were awkward and confusing.  Other than that it was a good read with potential for a great series.Keep in mind that this is a fantasy action adventure.  4* of 5*
2192,4,A turned female wolf finds love and a pack .after a rocky start our female alpha finds a mate and pack justice
2193,5,"This book is very hot. It isn't your normal romance, but who wants normal when you have a sexy doctor and a willing test subject. I don't know about anyone else...but I want a Dream Machine and if it comes with the good doctor, I'll take it. Jayne Rylon is an awesome author and I can't wait for more of her books. :)"
2194,4,"Rating:  4.5 starsThis book was a dark read and it is not anything like FSOG--it's about Master/slave and about a Dom/sub.  The story takes place at Judgment-a secluded fortress type mansion that holds hundreds of women captive and who will be sold into slavery. Callie first given the name Red because of her hair and later renamed Mischief by her Master was kidnapped and brought to Judgment. When Mischief arrives at the compound she fights her captives and pays the price. Her defiance earns her attention from Tane-the head Master-on her first night at Judgment. Her defiance continues as does his fascination with her.Her defiance continues and that is what earns her the name Mischief. She is eventually broken when she tries to escape and lands in the arms of Tane. He sentences her to a caning and waiting she does something that earns her a total of 30 strikes of the cane.While we are learning about how Mischief was captured and tortured into complete submission the author also dives into the physiological state of Mischief. There are other interesting aspects to this story.  There is a whole hierarchy of slaves-the top being Personals.When presented with a real chance of escape I was shocked at her response-which really just goes to show you how beaten down and broken she really became.  Overall, there are some twists and turns in this story and there is ALOT of violence and some steamy scenes. I found myself talking to my iPad because I was baffled, appalled, or just totally shocked by some scenes.Thanks for reading my review!!"
2195,5,I absolutely enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it to any kindle reader who enjoys this type of story.
2196,4,"It wasn't what I was looking for, but still liked the stories.  They will keep the readers' attention - NOT in an Agatha Christie way - but still gripping.You will have to get used to the way they are written, but when a story is good (or at least, holds one's attention), that is the least of the reader's worries."
2197,3,"Synopsis:  Rich boy meets girl, they go on a date, have sex, and fall head over heals in love (no pun intended). This was my first story by this author.It was just okay. Not a unique spin on the Cinderella tale. Not even the fairy drag queen was unique as I know this was done before. Needless this story was not a deterrent from author's other works.Would I recommend this to a friend?  No! Sorry."
2198,3,I really did enjoy reading this story. It's the kind of book that makes your heart flutter. My only complaint is that it's so short. It would be a great start to a novel.
2199,5,"What's not to love? With the ebook, it'll be the best .99 you ever spent.Wistril is a wizard. Okay, we've heard that story before, right? Not really. Wistril is a white chair wizard who can't throw thunderbolts at the bad guys to defeat them. Instead, he has to be wily and sneaky to save the...well, not the entire world, but at least Castle Kauph.With his intrepid apprentice, Kern, and a horde of faithful gargoyles led by the intrepid Sir Knobby, Wistril figures out how to defeat the bad guys in these three fun tales of magical mayhem.Frank Tuttle has a knack for humorous fantasy. Great writing, fun plots, fast action."
2200,5,"Let me start this review off by saying that no one, and I mean NO ONE can write for Boba Fett as well as Karen Traviss can.  When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.  It really is too bad that she and the rest of the Star Wars writers had a falling out due to creative differences and that she is no longer writing for Star Wars.  I would have loved to read more of her work in a Star Wars setting."
2201,4,"Chloe and Zoe may be twins, but they couldn't be more different. Zoe is outgoing, adventurous, lives a life of luxury and seems to have no problem finding men to be with. Chloe is shy, reserved, likes her humble lifestyle and her teaching job. She may not admit it out loud, but she's always felt invisible, living in her glamorous sister's shadow.When Zoe asks her for a favor to meet with a client and pretend to be her, there is just one small problem - Zoe isn't an investment banker. She's a Dominatrix. Before she knows what's happening, Zoe  has given Chloe a complete makeover - mousey pony tail gone - check, sexy makeup - check, leather bustier, mini skirt and thigh high stiletto boots - check, mask adorned with colorful feathers - check. Pressed for time, she's shuffled out the door and heading towards Zoe's office to meet her client, Mark Jacobs. The job shouldn't be too difficult if she's the one giving orders, and she only has to follow three rules: One - Don't lose control, Two - Don't ever have sex with the client and Three - Don't take off the mask.Of course things don't go quite as planned and Chloe soon finds herself in a role reversal with Mark in charge. Well, there went rule number one :)I liked this short story. There were two twists I wasn't anticipating, so I like a little surprise. Chloe found a side of herself she never knew was there, or perhaps it just took the right man to bring it out of her. Mark could never find the type of woman he was looking for (that's part of the secret of this story), but Chloe's big heart comes through where it counted the most. Mark was highly skilled *cough* and um, very well endowed. Of course there's drama when another secret is revealed and I understood why she felt betrayed. Luckily Mark knows all the right words to say and they both get their HEA.There isn't really any BDSM play per se in this story, just hot seduction and a bit of kink involving dirty talk, being tied to a St Andrews Cross and a bit of tying down."
2202,2,"No love here. If you are looking for a quick tale of lust with LOTS of sexually explicit language, go for it! If you are like me and don't mind a good sex scene as long as it means something, than this book will be just as disappointing for you. It was a short book, author's writing style, not bad. Premise not so bad, but for me the lust never really evolved for me. Hero started out as a rich selfish bastard, and did not change enough for me. Not enough love or depth of character."
2203,5,"Conrad is a very powerful vampire who leads a life full of parties in San Francisco 1969. When one night a dark haired beauty walks into one of his parties uninvited. Conrad takes one look at her and knows he must have her. Desert Rose is already in conversation with his lover Armand but this does not stop Conrad, there's something about her that he's drawn to. This will not be more then one or two night Conrad tells himself just fun, after the first kiss he knows he's lying to himself, they are both already lost to each other.(Jump ahead 40 years) Conrad is missing and Damian his old friend has no other options but to involve two young vampires (Marc & Julia). Conrad has kept them secret for many years, their secret that can't get out. To many things hing on this secret.Find out what happens with Desert Rose and Conrad, who are these young vampires, what happens to Armand, what is this big secret, and who is Damian.This was a great book, I couldn't put it down. I love how PG Forte gets into the story. She jumps from past to present to be sure you don't miss anything. Her characters are strong, you will form quick opinions of them and then she goes and does something to make you change that opinion. I have become a fan of this series and can't wait to dive into the next book, Old Sins, Long Shadows."
2204,1,It started out so well and very interesting but the relationship ends before it even begins. I would love to have read this story flushed out in to an actual book.
2205,5,Destination wedding are all the rage.  Never heard of wedding s like this but these are great friends. I was surprised she ran so far so fast.
2206,5,I have just finished this story and I can't wait for more of the same from this author. I loved the characters. They were all a little different but not without their own idiosyncracies and warmth.  I particularly liked the exchange between Hagan and the Fae. That had me laughing out loud.The story was fast-paced and the hero was tough but vulnerable with an interesting quirky power.Yes there were quite a few typos and errors - more than a few really - and they were annoying but the story was good enough that they didn't put me off.There were many treasures in this book waiting to be unearthed.  I am sure I missed most but I did pick up on the Fritz Leiber one and that made me smile.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy with a dash of realism and a hero who is worthy of the role.  Five stars despite the errors.
2207,3,"I had the feeling based on the title that this was not going to be a piece of fine literature, but ...well...it still disappointed me.it has potential.  there is an intriguing back story of the ""hero"" belonging to a group of powerful spies known as the Archangels, but that aspect is barely even fleshed out.Speaking of flesh....That's basically all this book is.  There are much better offerings.  I equate this to a Cinemax after dark video when it so easily could've been so much more."
2208,5,I'm well and truly hooked on Elizabeth Lennox I absolutely love her stories and characters she reminds me of a romantic realist!!I have read many of her stories and she never has dissapointed me .One of her books is a great way to escape reality for an afternoon they are light with a touch of humor and lots of love
2209,5,"Everything about this story is enjoyable, from the beginning to the end. There are enough little twists to keep readers guessing until the details are revealed, each at exactly the right moment in the story. The ending is completely satisfying and perfect for the story. This is a story I would gladly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good romance, especially one with a touch of the paranormal thrown in. - Karin"
2210,4,"Initially I thought this was going to be more of a creature type horror story, similar to The Mist. It's not, while they hint of something in the fog it is never explained, all you know is whatever goes in ends up screaming and me ere coming back out. Instead it's more about how a camp full of kids set out to survive and establish a community. The best comparison I could give is a modern day Lord of the Flies meets Hatchet. These kids manage to not only to survive but thrive and do better than most of the adults you will meet along the way.I wish they would have explained the fog more. It attempts to at the very beginning but then never explAins further. It doesn't detract from the story at all it's just my own curiosity, I want to know! That really is my only complaint. The story pulled me in and all the characters felt real.I would recommend this for older middle school age children to adult. If you enjoyed reading Hatchet by Gary Paulsen or Lord of the Flies I believe you would enjoy Surviving The Fog."
2211,5,Love this book. I read the series out of order but I think this might be the hottest. I loved both Sarah and Gabe. I love a strong Dom. I also love that Sarah's abilities are superior to Gabe's but she submits to her man willingly. (That is until he pisses her off)I love the humor and the jealous squabbles.Chloe pissed me off a few times but it was all cool.Love the stories recommend the entire series. It feels like a real community and family. (Full of nuts.)
2212,4,"Quinn and Libby McKay had been together for fourteen years, but for the last three months, Libby had been living by herself after kicking her husband out.  She couldn't go on the way they had been.  They were no more than roommates, and she decided to either shake things up, or let go and move on.  It had truly shocked her that he seemed to take it in stride until he saw her dancing with someone else one night at Ziggy's.  Quinn had lost his temper, and that gave her some hope, but when he walked away not wanting to cause a scene, she was ready to give up.When Quinn showed up at the library waiting at her car, Libby didn't know what to think.  Hearing him ask for a second chance, and his proposition that she spend a weekend alone with him, she didn't know what to think.  Libby was further surprised to hear his agreement that he would give her time to think after their time together that was uninterrupted and free from pressure.  They had been so far apart from each other the past year that Libby was afraid to get her hopes up.  Knowing this was their last chance, she skeptically agreed.This was a different spin in that we witness the demise of a good marriage between two basically kind hearted people.  They allowed other issues come between them, and instead of tackling them head on, they tried to deal with them alone separating them farther.  Can these two find the path back to each other?  A good read with strong characters.  Rough Rider readers will appreciate this story."
2213,5,"What a great read!  I have found myself attached to these characters and enjoying the ride through their stories and adventures.  The more I read about Ryson and Lief the more I like them, I liked the new characters added this time as well.  The story was exciting and kept my attention, action, action and more action, never a dull moment. Can't wait to read the next one."
2214,5,This is a must read! The first of the series I fell in love with the character's. Josh is a sweet bad boy and Alex comes off as strong but sweet. I love these wolves and the book was exciting from start to finish.I couldn't stop reading. must read
2215,5,"I personally loved Mark's twist on the zombie. No one complained when Zack Snyder and James Gunn made George Romero's zombies run in the Dawn of the Dead remake. I loved the creativity, suspense, and to be honest, this book and the series scared the crap out of me. I always recommend TZC to my friends and always will be a big fan of Mr. Clodi's work. Keep up the great work, Mark. I'll continue buying and promoting! :)"
2216,3,"This story was all over the place, with a lot of sawing back and forth.  Didn't really make me want more."
2217,5,"A REALLY GREAT STORY! it has alll the good stuff, plus the emotions along with it..SPOILERS!!!!The story starts out with Adelina looking for a ""perfect"" boyfriend, to fool her family. She finds him but she also finds herself in love with a very-almost-unmarried man, Will. While she's put thru hell from her family (and I mean HELL) she also has to deal with Will's almost ex-wifes psychotic behavior. While Will is tending to his crazy wife, Ed (Will's Playboy brother) decides to help Addie out. He treats her like she is supposed to be treated. Will can't seem to choose Addie, who he swears he's in love with, or his conniving wife.  Leaving Ed to pick Addie's broken heart over and over again.Now, I know Will loves Addie, but he feels obligated to his wife. Ed is your typical playboy. If it has two legs and boobs, he's all over it! But Addie is different. He doesn't just want to Wam Bam her, he wants her friendship as well.In the end Addie has to make an choice... I think because this and her mother's ""confession"", I have never cried like that before. I just wish Addie had picked both men... I would've! LoL.. Will may have made a ton of mistakes but he really did love her.Now I have to read the 2nd book in the series for Wills' HEA"
2218,5,"the first time i got the books i got all 14 of them for free for my kindles but i kept mixing them up and had to use a cheat sheet to get them back in order, until i found this. i bought a copy for me then i bought one for my mom thinking she would read it. i dont mind that there are no pictures but it doesnt matter. when you read the books you make your own pictures in your mind to go along with the story. if you love the books and want to keep them in order then you should get this book. its less than $1 and worth it, there are 3 more books that you can get for free that tie into the Oz series, if you would like to know what they are i will let you know"
2219,3,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 5/10PROS:- Anderson captures the annoying-yet-somehow-still-endearing antics of college boys quite well: the wrestling, the teasing, the constant put-downs, etc.- As much as I was annoyed at the two guys' refusal to just admit to their attraction for each other, I can't deny the fact that I snickered every time the phrase ""double dare extreme gay chicken"" (or something similar) came up.- There's a bit of angst, but it's the right amount for the story. It adds a bit of conflict without carrying on for too long.CONS:- Tall, burly men who play soccer are not entirely unheard of, but the majority of soccer players are average-sized or even smaller-than-average because there's such a call for speed and agility in the sport. The moment I read that our two heroes in this story are the stars of their college soccer team and are 6'4"" and 6'5"", I couldn't help rolling my eyes a bit at the impression of sensationalism I got. Add to that the fact that goalkeepers in soccer are generally referred to as ""keepers"" rather than ""goalies"" (as the story refers to them), and the entire setting lost its believability for me.- As soon as I lost the fight to prevent my eyes from rolling the first time, I was a goner. SO much about this story was silly to me: straight roommates who not only sleep in the same bed, but also cuddle, ""their bodies touching, their arms around each other""? Please. Guys who are so competitive that they'll go as far as kissing each other in a game of ""gay chicken"" just to prove how macho they are? Right.Overall comments: I would certainly pass on reading this ever again. It's not badly written; I just couldn't get past the premise. Every contrived situation the men found themselves in made me curl my lip yet again, and although I liked the protagonists okay, I was annoyed enough by their inability to admit their feelings that I didn't care too much about how things ended up."
2220,4,"Ten years ago, a family was torn apart when a young wife and mother was murdered.  An investigation took place, but nobody was charged with the crime.  All these years, Dinah learned to put the past behind her.  But now Marc was back to get the answers of his wife's murder and clear himself because his thirteen year old son was asking questions.The action in this book was a bit snow for a suspense.  But the author shocked me.  I thought I knew who it was, but I didn't.The romance was non-existant until the very end.  I thought that was a bit unrealistic.The book was interesting enough though."
2221,4,"I liked the creative ideas, the making and building of items.  The whole story was great...except for the killing of so many animals.  the book was written at a different time in the history of the world, the language is interesting to read and understand.  To distroy so much when now we need to save out plantet hurts  to read and think about.The book is worth the reading...as is all of this authors books.Naturally we would perfer he not kill the leading mystery man and the many life forms.The writer was a genuis."
2222,5,What a brilliant book. The heroine was spunky and the hero macho and sexy - and both likeable.Our lovely heroine carried around a lot of anger and let it be the focus of many acts in her life -  including her sexual adventures with the raedjour.  When Diana finally mets her match the sparks fly.This book and series are highly recommended. After reading this book I've read the next three shortly after [you just want to know what happens with the raedjour next - as the series develops it gets really exciting].
2223,3,Too much back & forth.  I enjoyed it but could put it back down until I kept saying it'd get better.  It did
2224,3,"I thought this book was a pretty good read. I like steamy sex scenes, so I was pleased in that domain. Thought the story could have used some development in terms of some plot points, but overall, I thought it was worth the read, especially since I scored it on a free download day."
2225,1,"This was a very informative book. It was interesting to learn how people in another era, lived and the  hard lives they had. You learn what it was like to live without all the conveniences  that people have today, and how there were few doctors."
2226,5,"My husband is retired military, so I've always been a sucker for a good military romance. This story drew me right in. Jesse got dumped in the worst way. She didn't have time for a broken heart. She picked herself up, and went to work as a waitress to work a double shift. Before the night ended she ended up passing out and landing in the arms of Brock, a handsome Navy sailor.From that point they became friends. He had to deploy shortly after, and they emailed daily learning more about each other every day. That friendship turned into love once he was home.Brock had some past issues to deal with. He had withdrew from his family many years before because of a tragic accident. He thought his family blamed him. They didn't, they just wanted to be a part of his life. I really felt the emotions when he visited with his family. That part really pulled on my heartstrings!I loved this story, it was funny, filled with love, and emotions, and was also very sweet in places.Sample from chapter oneHow embarrassing to fall flat at his feet. Maybe if she stayed very still, he and the others gathered around would leave her to expire of mortification on her own. Yeah, she thought as listened to the advice being jockeyed back and forth, that was her best course of action. She has a good chance of the earth opening up and swallowing her whole. This was California after all. Where was a good earthquake when you really needed it? ""She's not responding,"" another voice stated. ""Time to call 911.she needs to go to the hospital."""
2227,5,"I read all three in the Delver series and enjoyed them all.  They were well written and unique.  Jeff Inlo was able to create a world the reader can care about, and want to delve deeper into.  All three books were well worth my time to read them."
2228,3,"But I was expecting something more the pace of Around the World in 80 Days, and this dragged in spots. I ended up skipping a lot of parts where they were making things, and was a little incredulous how easily everything came to them and all they were able to accomplish."
2229,5,"I loved it! Wow! Whoa!!!AWESOME! I was a bit... bothered by the words for the male organ but.... MAN! Katrina, YOU ROCK!This book, though confusing on some parts Is A W E S O M E. AWESOME!!!"
2230,5,This book was short and sweet. Josephine and Blake's relationship was hot and sweet. Both had an unforgettable night together but Blake's insecurities stopped what might have been and drove Josephine into his philandering cousins hands. Tragedy brought them together and Blake is doing everything to keep her with him. The relationship was sweet and ended nicely but I just wish there was more.
2231,4,"Samantha Cross promised her mother that she would always take care of her brother.  When he once again lands himself in jail, this time for trying to steal a Montgomery Ranch bull, Samantha finds herself the one in danger.  Forced to go to the Montgomery Ranch to plead her brother's case and ask her brother's employers to drop the charges against him, Samantha is not prepared for the instant attraction she would feel for both men.  Evidently they feel the same way because Samantha has just agreed to become their housekeeper for the next year in return for the Montgomery brothers allowing her brother to go free.  How she will get through the next year without succumbing to the lust that pulsates through her body is a question that Samantha begins asking herself almost immediately.  All too soon that thought is forgotten as she finds the home she never had with two of the most enticing men she has ever met.Jackson and Shayne Montgomery share all things - their ranch, their house, and their women.  Jackson is the easier going of the two and he is the one the women talk about.  Shayne is more intense, and a whole lot larger than some women are comfortable with.  As such, he prefers to stay home on the ranch and share the women Jackson brings home.  Scared of his crudeness and afraid of hurting Samantha, Shayne fights his feelings for her every step of the way.  Thank goodness she is more tenacious than he, because she shows him exactly what it means to be loved.DAKOTA RANCH CRUDE is the second book of Leah Brooke's highly successful series, DAKOTA HEAT.  Ms. Brooke pulls no punches with the eroticism and heat of DAKOTA RANCH CRUDE.  The love scenes are scorching hot as are both male lead characters.  Their intense and supreme satisfaction at the hands of the woman they love left me blushing more than once.  I highly recommend DAKOTA RANCH CRUDE - it was wicked hot!Natalie S."
2232,4,"I really like Lauren Dane's Contermpory Romances and I am excited to find out this is the start of a serie set in Davis, California.  We have a big close family with wonderful parents on both sides.  The heroine is quirky and uptight and going through a career crisis. The hero is yummy and knows himself. Snuggle up and enjoy!"
2233,4,"Surprisingly well written, although it is directed at at an audience younger than its YA designation. Tweens I should think, and perhaps some of the younger avid readers. Certainly less sophisticated than Vampire Academy. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
2234,5,"My Review by Carlyn - BMR Guest ReviewerLark has been in love with her cousin Taran for years. Don't worry they are cousins only by a late marriage so no ick factor! What she doesn't know is that she is actually the alpha wolf, Taran's, mate. He has been keeping his feelings and his mating instinct a secret because he thinks she will reject him because they are family. When Lark becomes in danger after inadvertently becoming involved in one of Taran's police investigations he must protect her and his own heart.In this world, werewolf's are a known species so there was no big species shocker for Lark which made the storyline flow with ease. I really liked the characters in this story. Taran is still a gruff and bossy alpha wolf but he still has a sense of humor and you can understand why he kept his feelings from Lark. Lark is absolutely hilarious and she loves teasing Taran. She is also not afraid to go after what she wants when she puts her mind to it.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves shifters, romance and some red hot love scenes! I look forward to reading more books from this author.5 out of 5 stars."
2235,5,"I was in the mood for a vampire story and this novella fit the bill perfectly. On her way home from dropping her car at the garage after her hospital shift, Kristen is attacked by a rogue vampire. Her life changes overnight.&lt;&lt; It started with a little extra horniness. Everything male on two legs looked good to me. Even Gus, my seventy-year old neighbour, seemed to be more charming and attractive. >>She starts feeling ill and in desperation, seeks medical attention.&lt;&lt; ""Who bit me? Who did this to me?""""Don't you know?"" She gave me another pitying glance as she signed my release order. ""You've been bitten by a vampire. There is no antidote - no cure. In order to survive now, you need another bite."" >>She hasn't been turned into a vampire, but she needs one as her blood is now addicted. Through an anonymous hotline, she hooks up with random vampires across her city as a `donor'. They drink her blood, she gets her fix of venom and can cope for a few days more in her normal life. Then the night comes when she needs a fix - and the only available donor is the hot garage owner, Joe. She had no idea he was a vampire. He had no idea she was a donor.&lt;&lt; There was sympathy in his dark eyes but danger too. Like a starving carnivore suddenly faced with prey it knows it must not touch. ""I'm sorry you're in a bad way but I can't do this with you. I know you."" >>Unwilling for any kind of commitment, Joe makes a practice of only taking blood from strangers and is horrified at the prospect of becoming intimate with Kristen. He's been slowly falling in love with her for months - withouther having any idea - and now he feels guilty for what's happened to her.&lt;&lt; ""I knew there was a rogue loose in the area,"" he admitted at last, his deep voice rumbling with some private pain. ""Knew I ought to see you safely on that bus, but you seemed so damn sure of yourself. I thought you'd be okay."" He looked at me. ""I'm sorry."" >>Kristen has had few boyfriends and feels that her generous curves make her unattractive. Joe seems to think differently.&lt;&lt; Joe carried me as if I weighed no more than a feather pillow, which was both surprising and gratifying. Once your dress size gets into the double digits those Gone with the Wind-moments tend to get fewer and farther between, at least in my personal experience. But he wasn't even breaking a sweat. >>She's confused. He treats her so well.&lt;&lt; ""You all right?"" His deep voice was reluctantly gentle, as if I were a stray kitten he'd found out in the rain and was taking care of even though he really didn't want a cat. >>It's a confusing relationship. She needs his venom, he needs her blood. But there seems to be more to it, including the best sex she's ever had. And then suddenly, she has the chance of a cure. If they can find the rogue that bit her, there's a slim chance - a one-off - that she can go back to her old life and live normally again. Only if she does, Joe won't ever see her again. He'll go back to using strangers for blood and sex.&lt;&lt; What we had shared was something so intimate I would never have even considered doing it with a man I didn't care deeply for. To find out that he didn't feel the same way hurt in a way I couldn't even describe. >>Kristen slowly learns that what you want is sometimes not so obvious.&lt;&lt; If this was a twelve-step program I would be all the way to step twelve by now - whatever that was. Hell, I could be in a venom anonymous group standing up right now saying, ""Hello, my name is Kristen and I'm a venom addict but I'm four months clean."" Four months miserable was more like it. >>There were so many bittersweet moments and so many more quotes I wanted to use, but instead, I would just encourage anyone to read this. It's a different slant on vampires, but a delicious one. 5 out of 5."
2236,5,This is such a moving story of an abused girl who grows up and faces her demons in the end. Such a long hard struggle but it does open your eyes to how things are swept under the carpet before they do something about the problem.I highly recommend readers to read this. This is only a short example of her story.please get hold of the full story and you will not be disappointed.
2237,4,"I like old-fashioned westerns and I like to read those by Zane Grey. He is a particularly good writer, and many of his rip-roarin' westerns have rightly become classics. But be aware a goodly number of his books are more ""prairie romance"" than action-packed western, and in these there's often more huff and bluff than gunfire. Many of his books were not set in the ""old west"" of the past but in ""modern"" times, meaning contemporary to when he wrote them; these often depicted a rugged male abiding by a highly developed sense of fair-play and moral integrity (in contrast to the sneaky ""villain"" who did not), a chaste female heroine, misunderstanding, romance, and overall wholesomeness leading to a happy ending. Several works in this collection--though they  may be set in the western states--are not what we would normally call ""westerns,"" and others are baseball stories and nonfiction accounts of fishing and camping. Sadly the majority of his greatest westerns are not yet inexpensively or freely available in public domain editions. No matter what he wrote (prairie romance, baseball stories, fishing accounts, or classic westerns), Grey knew how to tell a good story, and his vivid descriptions are second to none.UPDATE 05-08-13: You may wish to compare this set of 26 to another Zane Grey collection recently published by Wildside Press as ""The Zane Grey Megapack."" Attractively formatted and offering 42 novels and stories for only $.99, that now seems like the better deal."
2238,1,"This book is wrong on so many levels and although I don't usually type spoilers I will for this one..Hope is the daughter of one of the scientists at the lab Wolfe is held at. Although he marks her, he refuses to mate her because of her age. The labs burn down and Wolfe is believed dead for  years. Hope is alone and unable to move on with another man because of the bond.Hope's evil mother apparently knows Wolfe survived because she has been sending him photos of Hope with other men. (Fake of course). Wolfe appears out of nowhere, captures Hope, and punishes her by teasing her with sex, and not allowing orgasms. Due to the mating heat she is apparently writhing in pain while he continues to try getting the answers he seeks.If you find nothing wrong with the above, it gets worse!First time for her and he sticks it in her ass.When he finally out of no where does a 180 and decides she is innocent, he doesn't want to to relieve her because he might be to rough and his animal is at the surface!? What?!Of course she begs, they have their orgasms, and all is forgiven. There's some joking. And then her mother shows up for a quick (falling sandbags of all things) take down.This is a joke, the writing is just (not even good ) sex with some attempts at a story thrown in."
2239,4,"One of my Guilty Pleasures is a love at first site story. Winter Solstice is one of those books that appeals to dreamers and people who believe in fate, destiny and the magic of soul-mates.I felt the connection between Reece and Destiny from the moment they bumped into each other.  Ms. Bradley did an excellent job of  putting me in both Reece and Destiny's heads.  There is depth of emotion between the two I did not expect to find in a 45 page novella.  The sex is hot and sweet, I absolutely melted every time Reece said ""my darlin"".Winter Solstice is a great short read, perfect for an escape from your hectic day with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. It's sweet, sexy and makes one yearn for their own soul-mate, someone to have that soul deep connection with."
2240,3,"This is a short story (49 pages on my e-reader) and overall it was just okay.Marcus is a collector of Roman artifacts who meets a gorgeous woman (Olivia) at the auction house when she catches his eye.  Immediately attracted, in what appears to be a mutual way, they set up a date for the next night.  Unfortunately Olivia's interntions are not completely honorable.Overall the story was just okay.  I probably would be annoyed if I had paid for it.  I don't have anything against short stories because they are sometimes a nice way to check out a uknown author without a lot of investment time and money wise.  That said, after reading this book I will not seek out other books by this author.Be warned it is a bit graphic."
2241,1,I'm embarrassed to admit I paid good money for this book.  Would have given it a 0 is offered!  Do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2242,5,There are not really enough superlatives ... or the time to describe this wonderful series!The very height of English fiction!Such power and plot excellence ... still fresh to this day!I have read every available tale 10 times ... and will read them over and over again in the future!
2243,5,I love the Wardens. I really do. but Shane was such a jerk! it was hard to like him at all. even the end!  it is a good read.  keep them coming!!
2244,5,"What do you get when you mix sci-fi and romance? Well if you're Cathryn Cade you get a compelling mix of the best of both genre's.In Tyger, Tyger Burning Bright we are introduced to the crew of the The Orion, the space ship version of a cruise ship. We meet some of the crew but this novel centers around the ships navigation officer Tyron Jag who goes through the mating shift while trying to navigate the new ship through an area of space that needs his expertise. We also meet Calla Fellura a novice crew member and the ships interpreter.The heat between Ty and Calla is intense, this is a total panty wringer, it is also amazingly well written with characters that are funny as well as sexy and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages and reaching for the next book. The world that has been created and the species that are developed are both fun and imaginative.While each novel is self contained it is best read in order so the sub plots in the novels are more understood."
2245,3,"First book in ""Dakota Heat Anthology"". Followed byDakota Ranch Crude. Note thatDakota Heat, Volume 1appears to contain both (first two of 4), in paperback.Plot:Brothers Chase, Wolfe and Travis Dakota aim to seduce Stacy into spending the rest of her life with them. Maybe they should have let her know their plan?Comments:- Contemporary Cowboy Erotic Menage- 1430 kindle locations, 22,118 words- m/f, 1f:3m - very explicit, generous, loving, somewhat dominant, including outside, spanking for punishment, anal.Opinion:Big, strong, muscular Alpha male cowboys who have waited years for her ""to grow up"", so they could all have her, share her, love her. They protected her as much as they could from her father, they made her a home. And now the time was right for them to make her stay. And to do that they were going to love her into submission... Hmmm..Not as overwhelmingly Dominant as it could have been, with lots of hot sex; we are given a very steamy erotica story with a nice HEA. Is it believable? Who really cares? Sure, Stacy forgives and accepts awfully quickly, there's a lot of discussion of both the past and the future that is left unsaid. *shrug* Given the length of the book we couldn't really get much else in. More plot would have meant less smut, and we wouldn't have wanted that now, would we? In the end, Brooke gives us what we are after - lots of generous, loving, steamy sex with enough of a plot to hang it together. Enjoyable.-CR-"
2246,3,"Wasn't thrilled with the book, was a fast read. the book could have used more storyline to it, it didn't have enough meat to it."
2247,4,The Eagle series by Simon Scarrow is well worth following to the conclusion. I highly recommend these books. A satisfying read.
2248,3,Nice development of characters. Good plot but I would have liked to know more on the relation magic and the lighthouse's keepers.
2249,4,"This was a Free Kindle Book.  It seemed like a cross between king Aurthur's court and star wars.  Overall, it was good and I have already read two other books from him."
2250,1,Suspending one's disbelief is an utter necessity with this book.  There is a lot to disbelieve.  That's an okay requirement IF you're not constantly reminded how ridiculous the book is.
2251,5,"I read the first of these three novels a few years ago in hardback.  I loved it.  Why didn't I find the other two?  I don't know, but now that I have, I recommend them highly.  The characters are wonderful, both the hero and heroine AND Julia's enormous family.This is a wonderful bargain!"
2252,5,"A love story set in modern day New Zealand about betrayal and learning to trust again,  as well as earning the trust of  a beloved.  Did I mention this is also a paranormal shifter tale?  Very well done, and the first in a series about brothers, men who shift into panthers, and who need to find their life mate.  The author makes us care about the H/H, and their words, reactions and emotions are real and well written. This is also an erotically told tale. I will definitely be reading the rest of the series. I recommend Scarlett Woman for a satisfying love story."
2253,5,After i started it couldn't put it down for very long...Very Good. it's the kind of read i like.  I aim to read all of the Series.
2254,3,"There are a lot of good tips in this blog - how to do something, free book alerts, etc.  The author puts in a lot of time with this blog and there are usually 2-3 posts per weekday, although the weekend seems a little thin.  The how to's, etc. are invaluable to me and I hoep he keeps pumping them out.However, I get turned off at times with this blog with the endless self-promotion of his own book titles and what comes across as arrogance on prognostications and how evil the book publishers are: many times, I have read the same thing on someone else's blog which makes me wonder if I am getting a regurgitation / paraphrase with a self-congratulatory pat on the back.  If he toned this part down, he would probably have 2x however many subscribers there are now.Overall, this is certainly worth a buck per month!"
2255,4,"Okay I gave this short story **** because it was hilarious. The arguements between Alex and Helena were silly even borderline immature, but when you think of what was causing the arguements in the 1st place and considering the situation @ hand, it bought a certain level of realism to it. Especially their reactions to certain things. I was scared the way the book started off, that it would be really shallow, but I was pleasantly surprised by how you got glimpses of the main characters and what makes them tick, and how they generally lived before meeting one another. This made me care about the characters and kept me interested in the story. If you want some chuckels/laughs with a side of a little bit of shock factor then I suggest this book."
2256,5,"Many opinions in the reviews people have written for this series over the 4 books.  Some love it, some hate it.  It was too much for some and some were perfectly satisfied.  I personally loved  this series and Lora Leigh is one of my very favorite authors.  For me this series was different for sure, but I found it to be engaging, emotionally intense and very hot.  The brothers sharing was not something most would understand, but Lora did her best to explain the August brothers reasons for what they did.  It's not that that made it ok, it did, however, explain why THEY did it from their perspective.  This last book in the series totally brings everything to completion and the brothers and their wives each find themselves and I felt fully satisfied with the results.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!!!"
2257,5,Very cute and refreshing. An unexpected twist on in the series. I just loved it and I am moving on to the next book in the series.
2258,1,"I downloaded this book as a Kindle freebie.  I liked the title and thought it would be a light story about an encounter between a delivery man and one of his customers.  It isn't.  This is the product of 1,000 monkeys banging on their typewriters and flinging poo.  Have you ever been watching TV with a friend who keeps flipping channels?  That's what this book is like.  The author stays on one storyline for a few paragraphs before switching to another.  It's very awkward and will give your brain whiplash.  A few chapters in I was starting to wonder if the author just cut and pasted several different snip-its from drafts that she had on her computer.  There's blatantly obvious editing errors and inconsistencies.  Then there's the ""ick"" factor - a husband telling another man to ""do"" his wife and a swimmer fantasizing about a ""golden shower""?  Gross.  If you've clicked on this page, back away slowly, return to where you came from.  There's better options."
2259,4,Very nice story. Lots of romance and love making. The storyline is very good with plenty of interest to keep you want to read more
2260,2,I read all three books and they were entertaining but very slow to develop.  Once you get where your being led you not suprised.  I lost Intrest several times and had to leave it and come back.  The good new is that it was no charge.  I guess you get what you pay for
2261,5,"Bobby Blackhawk and Cale Yancey have shared the dream of owning a small ranch since they met in Ag class in high school.  After a stint in the military they finally had the funds to make their dream a reality.  Their place is located in the Colorado mountains.  During snowstorms the route to town from their home is impossible.  Fortunately in lieu of a female during these times Bobby and Cale are more than compatible and have no qualms about helping each other out if and when the need arises.After catching her fianc&eacute; cheating on her again, Katherine Duvall makes the decision to escape the intolerable situation.  She leaves behind her engagement ring, grabs the rental car keys and drives off completely ignoring the bell staff's warning about driving without snow chains in the stormy weather - and that almost proved to be detrimental.Fortunately for Kate, Bobby and Cale are on their way home from town when they notice her vehicle and become concerned because it's obvious she isn't used to driving in snowy weather.  The men follow the other car for ten miles and just when they think she might make it and not slide off into the river it happens - her car fishtails and slides off the road into the freezing water.When it becomes obvious that Kate isn't thinking straight enough to save herself, Bobby goes into the water to rescue her.  It falls to Cale to get Bobby and the woman back to the truck and then to their home where he strips them all down and climbs into bed between them to use his own body heat to warm them up.  He just never anticipated they'd end up sharing so much more - though he certainly isn't complaining!Delilah Devlin's storylines never fail to pull readers into the story and SADDLED is no exception.  Bobby and Cale have very different personalities and expectations so it's extremely interesting how they respond both individually and together toward Kate.  Kate displays a vulnerability and honesty that really drew me to her.  Of course the sex scenes are scorching and adventurous with the perfect blend of emotional turmoil to ensure readers keep Ms. Devlin's name at the top of their `must read' list.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"

Great scences and plot"
2263,5,"I LOVED this story!! I would give it more stars, if I could. It was so well-written, I re-read it immediately, lingering on the details. I loved the dark, edgy, REALLY bad boy anti-hero, who was definitely NOT perfect.  The heroine is beautiful, but that is not dwelled upon as much as her character: good, brave, valiant and proud, but stressed, lonely and tormented, too. The writing is extremely good, top notch. The characters are extremely well-defined and believeable, especially for such a short work.  The sex is steamy, sensual and actually necessary to the story.  The editing is extremely good; no typos, grammatical errors, misspellings, or missing/wrong words.The fans of perfect-hero-and-heroine-happily-ever-after-all-wrapped-up-in-a-neat-package may not ""get"" this story.  The hero, Dardanus, is an assassin and womanizer:  highly intelligent, devious, bitter, and full of anger at the lifetime of cruelty and disrespect he has received as a royal bastard. Although he is a trusted advisor to Nestra, the queen, he is killing and scheming his way to take the throne from her, because he deems her too weak to rule the country effectively. But for all that, he is a man of principle (his own code, not others'), a patriot who loves his country.  The magic amulet Nestra wears protects her from attempts on her life, so he schemes to seduce her into removing the amulet, so that he can kill her. What happens is a very touching story of love and redemption, with a great twist.*Spoiler Alert* Even though many reviewers did not understand the ending (and so assumed it was NOT happily ever after), it HAD to be a happy ending, for this reason:  The entire story was told in the first person, from Dardanus' point of view.  Therefore, even though it ends with his belief that he will die in the morning (as a result of his actions), he is alive and telling the story, so the queen MUST have forgiven him.I got this as a free download, but this author's work is so awesome, I am definitely going to spend actual money to buy more of her work, ASAP."
2264,4,"The world building in this was very good, I'm intrigued and looking forward to reading more in this series. The leads were solid, nice HEA and the lose threads were just enough to get me interested in reading more, but not to much that I felt the author held back."
2265,4,Ok this book was good but the ending? It's like I was missing pages or something. It's a good read but I hate you are forced to buy part 2-10 just to get the story. Oh we'll let me go 1 click for part 2.
2266,5,"I was intrigued by the description, sucked in by the sample, and pissed when I found out there was only 3 books in the series. I liked it that much. Thankfully she branched off this trilogy with the glass trilogy so I can continue to get my fix."

But, she has for some reason decided to go along with it, probably since she can't seem to say no to a friend in need, as long as she wears a mask.  She is surprised at how wicked it all makes her feel, and how she can let her lusty inner devil out.Detective Nick West is at the club, on his own time, trying to get Mistress Christmas to try and rob him, as his close friend claims happened to him.  He can't believe that the leggy brunette with the smoky eyes is the one responsible for the deeds his friend claims.  But she definitely gets his blood running at a fever pitch.Their attraction is mutual and when Holly blurts out her Christmas wish on the second night they meet he is only too happy to grant it.  The thing is one night might not be enough for either, can Holly reveal her real self to Nick? Will they both take a chance on love?But, with one misunderstanding it all might be lost.Mistress Christmas is a fantastic addition to the Wild West Boys.  This one from the West side of the family and in a big city no less.  I loved how Nick is thrown into falling for a woman he thinks there is no way he can have.  Another lesson in ""don't choose a book by its cover"".  Ms. James continues to keep me hooked on her books by writing fun and spunky characters.

Although Abby is more of an alpha wolf and Dylan is much more submissive, he knows he needs to get her out of this cruel pack. Near by is Red Rock Sanctuary, a pack led by Gavin and his mate Samantha. They take in runaways from these packs that have violent out of control alphas. They get word Dylan is on his way, but it starts to get late. Gavin sends one of his alpha wolves, Keith to investigate. Keith is an alpha in the pack and has spent years fighting in the wars against the wizards, so he is good in these situations. Keith discovers Abby and Dylan on the side of the road, fighting off a couple of Alan's wolves sent to bring them back. After Keith shoots them all (Did I mention he is lethal?) he escorts them safely to Red Rock.They are welcomed and given a safe place to stay. One of the first rules Gavin has is all new wolves need a Guide, someone to lead new wolves through the first couple of months. Not only teaching them the basics of being a shifter, but the bond usually goes much more intimate than that. At the end of the Guide period, the couple can choose to go their separate ways or sometimes feelings have developed and they stay together to explore their relationship.As soon as Abby and Keith meet, their wolves immediately take notice of each other. Their human sides are also very attracted. Abby has to be the one to choose the Guide, and not forced into the decision. Keith with an overwhelming protectiveness needs Abby to choose him, but being the gentleman he lets her have time to adjust and look over her options. Abby knows he is the one, and when the sexual tension is about ready to burst, she agrees and the first lesson he teaches her is in the bedroom. But the fun ends when Abby gets a picture of her sister, who has been kidnapped by Alan. With Keith's help, they race to save her.Cry Sanctuary is full of alpha male goodness. The moment Keith, or I should say his wolf sees Abby, that is it for him. He goes into growly, overprotective mode. He stalks around, on edge, being a perfect gentlemen towards Abby, but letting everyone know she is off limits. Years ago, he lost a lover, and the raw emotions from that relationship coupled with his alpha status, make for a very intense male. He sees being her Guide as an honor, and the thought of any other male near her makes him almost lose control.Abby also exudes alpha status, and although she is terrified and confused by her new life, she is a tough cookie. She accepts Keith from the beginning. I like that they never refuse or deny their attraction. When they come together, two powerful wolves in the bedroom, it's a smexy overload. Abby feels guilty for having these strong feelings for Keith and for wanting him sexually at the same time as having him for her Guide. It takes prodding from both Keith and some friends to convince her Keith wants the same thing.We also meet the other wolves of Red Rock. Leaders Gavin and Samantha run a tight ship but are very warm. Joe, Keith's friend stays his friend after he realizes Abby is off limits and provides some very sarcastic comments. Abby's friend Dylan, who is more submissive gets a book in this series and I can't wait to see what they do with his character. I sometimes thought all the residents of Red Rock, or at least the ones we meet are a little too perfect. Everyone is so nice and welcoming but you can argue Gavin is a strict alpha and doesn't let anyone get out of line. This book is also on the shorter side so we don't get a lot of background into the war with the wizards but there are several more books to the series and I'm looking forward to reading more about this group. Although there is a satisfying ending, there is much left to explore.Cry Sanctuary is a action filled paranormal romance, with plenty of alpha action to steam up the pages."
2270,5,"Joe and Colt have a long history together.  From grade school through prison--yes prison--where they were wrongly imprisoned.  Once they served their time, they decided they were going to hunt down the man that put them there and settle the score.  Heck they could kill the man and no one could do a thing, as they already served time for the crime.  When they find him they don't expect to find a little spitfire of a woman standing up to him.Dakota won't sell out her land to ""Big Ed"" no matter what he throws at her. Through fires, attacks and even stolen cattle she has held strong.  Heck the man even hired her former ""boyfriend"" away.  She has grown leery of people, especially as no one in town will help her.  When Joe and Colt show up on her property looking for work she tries to send them on their way.  Once they figure out she is the one standing alone against ""Big Ed"" they decide to take only yes for an answer.Dakota figures they will only stay long enough to be scared away but until then they are handy to have around and they definitely improve the scenery.  But will she be able to act on her lustful feelings or will she discover why they are really on her ranch?  Are they each what the other needs to heal and have a strong life together?Leah Brooke knows how to weave a couple of alpha cowboys into an interesting storyline with strong women.  Dakota's Cowboys continues to prove this fact and is the latest in the Dakota Heat series.  I enjoyed the interaction between Dakota and the new men in her life, and how she still sticks to her convictions and does what she feels is her job no matter what the men think.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
2271,4,"The first Hell Cop was incredibly enjoyable and something just that little bit different. In this 2nd book they're building on already established relationships and reading it was like visiting with old friends. God. I am such a sap. But it was just so good!Trust Me, by Astrid Amara, has Jay and Brian a year down the track. Jay still delights in being able to touch someone and Brian is growing into his own skin after the revelations' in the previous book. The growth of the characters relationship was beautifully done and the hook of Brian's lack of control was an engaging one. He begins to realize that his ability to touch Jay does not exclude him from being left and his need to learn to control his power, or risk loosing his lover, becomes paramount. A sexy, perceptively written story that does not just look at the surface of a relationship, but delves deeply into its workings.In Dark Waters, by Nicole Kimberling, the world building is tight and I like her attention to little things that make for vivid reading. The balance of power in a relationship, knowing when to listen and when to argue, brought a warmness to the story. Michael is such a professor and I like how out of his comfort zone he is with Argent at times, when he cannot use his mind reading powers. Parts were also surprisingly funny and had me laughing out loud. I think Bert's - a bunch of drunken goat-legged midgets and that poor, maligned turtle were rather amusing. hehe.Finally, in Such Heights by Ginn Hale, dark and broody Moran returns on another case with his blond and gorgeous journalist lover  James. Moran is still determined to resist till the last and I think there is nothing more satisfying than reading about this cop being brought to his knees. So to speak. O-o The floating palace was a very cool world with tentacle like spells and enslaved demons, which made for a cool backdrop for the characters.Freeloading, hippie mermaids, large bovine like creatures, pocket demons and castles that travel about in the air. These 3 authors write books that I want to read. Get it here from Loose Id. Also, check out Hell Cop 1 here."
2272,4,I love most everything N. J. Walters writes. She is one of my favorite authors. I enjoyed the book and look forward to more of her works.
2273,3,"It was funny, and enjoyable. The author made it believable and I enjoyed the factor that it was about  interior design"
2274,4,This first in the Sargent trilogy based in the Middle east introduces the cast of characters to feature in the subsequent volumes.  Well written and pacy the story grips from the beginning.  The quirky CIA operatives are supported by a cast of arab characters sympathetically portrayed to give a balance unusual in novels about this area.  The series as a whole demands further attention for this author and deserves a higher price tag than free or cheap for kindle.
2275,5,"Delaney scores with Book One of the Phoenix Rebellion, ""Revolution."" Set in the near future, Delaney puts together an ensemble cast of characters and pits them against the Areth for the survival of the human race.The Areth come from outer space and appear human. They've come to Earth and shared medical technology with us, but little else. A group of humans, ""The Phoenix Rebellion,"" believe the Areth do not have peaceful intentions toward the human race. Covertly, a member of the Rebellion, Dr. Caitlin Montgomery, infiltrates the Areth's medical complex in New Mexico. Caitlin learns that an Areth scientist, Kathleen, gave birth to a half-human, half-Areth child, Michael. Michael's father is a human, Col. Nick Tanner. Caitlin finds Nick in Maine and shares the information with him. He's stunned. He thought his wife and son had died in childbirth. Without a second thought, Tanner joins the Rebellion, despite the fact that his feelings for Caitlin are complicated due to their previous affair which ended badly.Nick finds General Castleton in Colorado and meets other members of the Rebellion - a married couple, Lilly, who is a doctor and her pilot husband, Jace. There's also an empath, Dr. Beverly Surimoto. After a carefully coordinated plan, the Rebellion attack the Areth's complex in New Mexico, hoping to free the Areth's subjects - including Michael. An Areth scientist, Victor, has befriended Michael and helps the Rebellion. All is not well with Victor though, as he begins having a mental breakdown. The escape from the Areth's complex in New Mexico is a thrill ride, but one of the Rebellion loses his life and the fate of the human race hangs precariously in the balance.Delaney's writing is sharp. After a quick introduction to the Areth, Delaney jumps into the story. The plot flows well, never lingering. Delaney uses a good economy of words to paint descriptions. It's easy for the reader to visualize her futuristic world.Delaney's characters are what makes this science fiction story shine. Col. Nick Tanner is a passionate man who has been hurt deeply in the past. Learning to trust Caitlin again is a struggle. Caitlin, for her part, realizes the folly of her youth, and tries to make up for it. The couple's chemistry is on a slow, smoldering burn that threatens to consume both when ignited. Victor's plight is heartbreaking, especially since he's an alien who shows Michael compassion. Michael's condition is intriguing. It's never fully explored in this book, leaving the reader wanting to discover more about him.The story is ""sophisticated"" for romance readers. Delaney's love scenes are intense, yet tasteful. Book One: Revolution is a story packed with adventure, excitement, and love, making it a thrilling start to ""The Phoenix Rebellion"" series."
2276,4,I really ejoyed this description of life in the Legion and how young Romans were entered into its ranks.  The adventures of Cato and Macro intrigued so much that I have purchased all the following titles of their adventures.
2277,4,"Although some comments about political or military actions are inprobable or incorrect, I found this story engrossing and the characters interesting.It also makes you think about possible future outcomes based on today's current events. How would you survive if the economy collapsed so far that jobs, food and fuel were in short supply? What would you do when faced with an epidemic where medical resources are scarce? How would you live if bombings and riots were an everyday part of life? What do civil rights mean when your country is being attacked from the inside?Well worth the price."

2279,5,"I had forgotten how much I enjoyed reading books by Grace Livingston Hill. I read this one first and it stood alone very well. I read the first book next, and am now reading the third in the series. The reader does have to &#34;self edit&#34; a bit due to the fact that the book was scanned with many resulting errors in transcription.Hiram was a villain who was easy to hate, as were Phoebe's jealous sister-in-law and niece. Phoebe was easy to love. She was incredibly strong when faced with much travail.I am giving the book 5 stars in spite of the transcription errors. It is that good. Besides, I need to get back to &#34;Miranda&#34;, the 3rd book in this trilogy. I highly recommend all Grace Livingston Hill books."

2285,4,"This is a fun read, like a fantastically cheesy Sci-Fi channel movie, but with a lot more sex.Basically, you've got a ship imperiled by the dual threat of an eco-terrorist on board and the main navigator being rendered useless by his &#34;tyger mating shift.&#34;  Apparently these things are controlled by the moon yet also somewhat unpredictable and now he's got to have a tyger female to mate with.  Oh, there's a cute young female tyger on board?  Well, awesome.They frolic in the garden.  That's the only reason to read the book (the plot is very basic) and the author delivers.  If you like lite-shifter alpha male scenes with a less experienced female, I recommend.  I don't recommend this for anyone who might be downloading this for the sci-fi (the sci-fi is simply the setting, the sex is why the story exists).  It's a really fun read, but not much more."
2286,5,"A Hardboiled Murder, an Annie Underhill Mystery. Michelle Ann Hollstein  writes a story of grandmothers, movie stars, grandsons, a marine, a police officer, an adulterer, a murder victim, an inscribed piece of jewelry, a spurned wife, and a tramride up the side of a mountain during fall foliage season. This is a breathtaking ride that involves a dead body falling from the roof of one of the tram cars. It involves a search on foot through the woods on the side of the mountain, with treacherous cliffs unseen in the dark. It's a story of family devotion, family competitiveness between grandmothers, and a story of a marriage between ages. It's a story of a book group, a callous lover, and an anticipated inheritance. It is quite a cast of characters, each carefully described in the foreword of the book and each well developed through the actions of the story. It is a delight to read, and another five star story."
2287,5,I love this series. I can't wait to read the others.  This family should have a wedding coordinator on retainer. They seem to get married every few months. Lol.

2290,4,Max Brand is one of the most underappreciated authors of Western stories. This collection should certainly be  a part of any aficionado's library

2298,5,"Sam and Lloyd, a couple of 11 year olds, hitch a ride in a stranger's car only to realize that it was the single greatest mistake of their young lives. They are taken to a big, old and creepy mansion and locked up separately. From the very beginning, one thing is clear to both the boys - the man had kidnapped them with cruel intentions. What will happen to them and how will they - if they do manage it - escape from the clutches of their kidnapper? How do they both deal with the situation?This is an amazingly gripping thriller. It gets so creepy at times that I had to look up a few times just to make sure that I was at the comfort of my own home and not stuck with those two 11 year olds! Yeah, I know that's weird, but true!! The sense of fear that appears in Sam and Lloyd once they realize that they had made a mistake in getting into a stranger's car, actually manages to settle into the reader. It is mainly because of the author's amazing narration and nothing else. Even though she doesn't give much time in building up the characters, as a reader you start to feel for the kids. Also, Ms.Savita's vivid description of every little detail helps us get into the comfortable feeling of knowing the surroundings of wherever the story takes us. The best (or the worst) part is that she actually doesn't tell us directly about the way the boys are treated. There are just hints here and there for us to pick up and then imagine the worst scenarios!! The two characters Sam and Lloyd seem to be very different from each other. While in danger, when Lloyd freezes, Sam is the one to jump into action. While we can applaud Sam's bravery, we cannot really blame Lloyd for being scared to do anything - he is after all an eleven year old.The book can also serve as a lesson to kids about how important it is to remain vigilant at all times. The world is after all full of people who can and do hurt children in all sorts of unimaginable ways. I would recommend it to all mature readers."

Now her childhood big-bad-wolf-nightmares are turning into real life adult fantasies. Is sexy businessman Gray Lupo the answer to her problems, or just a wolf in gentleman's Armani?Who said being eaten by the big bad wolf was a bad thing?Alison Paige has taken Little Red Riding Hood and given it an erotic and amusing twist.  With a strong heroine, a hot older Hero in denial, a spunky Granny, along with a cast of enjoyable characters, Alison really delivers a fun erotic read.  The love scenes were steamy, though some may find a few elements of certain scenes not their style.The fact that the werewolves in this story were much more primal and true to a wolf's nature was refreshing.  However, having said that, I do have to bring to light a couple of cons.  One, I think the story could've lost a couple of side stories which felt like it slowed the story down.  Two, with some of the side stories and elements, there wasn't a true resolution.  Three, Gray Lupo is the Alpha, but the pack/family didn't really treat him as such.  There were times when the manipulation was a bit too much and too brash for the alpha persona Gray was supposed to epitomize.Overall, I would suggest this story as a weekend erotic read.  It was a fresh take on Little Red Riding Hood's story.GMTA Rating:  3.5/ 5 RavensAge Recommendation:  18+"

I believe this book will keep your attention and that you will find it to be a worthwhile read."
2301,5,"What's most remarkable about this story is the degree of authenticity Klaver gives it-- it reads just like a story by Doyle (or Watson, if you prefer!). The attention to Victorian detail is also noteworthy, and it's clear that the author knows his Holmes mythology. You may think you've seen all that can be done with teh sub-genre of ""Holmes meets Dracula"" tales, but The Case of the Solitary Grave is exciting and refreshingly unpredictable. As a bonus, we get a very touching look at the deep bond of friendship between Holmes and Watson.Can't wait for the next adventure!"

A m&eacute;nage is quite the birthday surprise for Jodi.  Mark, Jodi and Sam heat things up in this lusty novel.  I like how Mark is immediately reconsidering not only his idea for the m&eacute;nage but the relationship.  There is nothing like seeing your woman getting it on with another man to make you realize how serious you are about her.  Private Property will leave you thinking that breaking and entering might not be such a bad thing.MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed"

Thankfully his brother Ben made him see things differently and once he pulled his head out damn did he do a great job of wooing back his wife.  I loved that this was a couple who was in a long term committed relationship and they just needed a spark to make them take a look at what they had and what they stood to lose if they couldn't communicate better and work through their issues.  It was fun to watch them re-discover the heat and lust they once had and stretch the boundaries of their sexuality.  Hot, hot, hot!*I knew in this book Ben's story was going to be something special.

I was surfing through amazon and realized they offered an application for the kindle so i bought random free books to see what it was about. This was one of the books. Very different and very steamy. The story is short and i read it in like three hours. Overall it really is a good story. It does leave you  kind of hanging but i ordered the second book of the series and it picks up from this book. So i really do like the book. ( i dont give any information about the book because i think you should read it for yourself, it is free after all. Although i think i would have paid for it now that i have read it.)I will say that the Sex Scenes threw me for a loop and i was NOT prepared for that.

Since buying my Kindle Fire I have read more books over the past year than the past 10 years combined! And now I can finally afford to buy the entire collection of Jules Verne.. It is wonderful to end one story and start another without ever leaving my couch! This Collection of Jules Verne does not disappoint this scifi fan."
2309,5,This is a very sweet story about the miracle of the Christmas season if you truly believe in the true meaning of Christmas. The only draw back was that the story didn't go deeper into the characters...it went straight to the happy ending. I expected to learn more about the shop owner.  However in today's society were people are ruthless and negative it's nice to read something uplifting and pure joyful.
2310,3,"I'm not sure what to think of this writer. Some works I've enjoyed, others not so much...such is the case for Charmed. I actually enjoyed the first half of the book...but who doesn't enjoy new lust and the chase of a mate? My interest was held, and I was enjoying the book. Then, the book took a turn, and everything became either boring or silly. I mean, I do expect some ridiculous-ness...this is a vampire romance,  afterall!  Unfortunately I have a short attention span for absurdity and boredom."

2314,4,"For centuries, the Prime have been battling their brutal enemies, the Antareans.  Facing extinction as they struggle against escalating Antarean attacks, the proud warrior race begins the process of uniting with the Galactic Alliance to ensure their future.Captain Wulf Caradoc, as the heir of the Prime leader, is expected to assist with negotiations on behalf of his people.  The secret, secondary part of his agenda is to look for his gemate, the genetically ideal mate that will be bonded to him mentally, physically and emotionally until the end of his days.  The ambassadorial team he is assigned to escort is attacked by space pirates hired by Prime malcontents.  Despite their skillful defense tactics, Wulf, his crew, and their charges are in danger until Alliance forces can reach them.Captain Melina Dmitros is a top-notch Galactic Alliance officer who's paid her dues.  After receiving a distress message from the Prime ambassador party, she steps in to aid them.  When she finally meets the future Prime leader face-to-face, she is ambushed by the biological force of the Prime mating urge.  She is his gemate, his fated match and a Lost One.  Her body will not allow her to survive without him, regardless of how she feels.  Wulf is willing to do whatever it takes to claim and protect his mate so that they may persevere against their enemies.The action kicks up a dust storm in chapter one of Prime Obsession that never settles!  I was convinced that Captain Dmitros was a first-rate adrenaline junkie from all the non-stop battles.  I rarely encounter a novel with multiple action scenes per interval.  Melina takes on bad guys, dodges hits, sniffs out/repairs sabotages, and keeps time with her man.  It's all in a day's work for a woman that knows her way around the Prime as well as the Galactic Alliance.  Wulf is growls and nibbles when it comes to his mate, although he's more than earned his formidable Prime warrior and sex machine title.  However, Melina is always center stage and in the thick of it all.  I started to feel that she was beginning to upstage her man.  Ok, ok.  Admittedly, I do prefer strong, accomplished female antagonists.  Still, Melina proved a bit overwhelming at times.Wulf's growling seemed uh, well...ridiculous after a while.  I've read novels with alpha males expressing their protectiveness this way, yet the constant repetitiveness became excessive and silly after a while.  Of course, it was a relief to have Wulf take charge after watching Melina prove just how tough and skilled she is over and over again. I could better appreciate the developing relationship.  The author does an amazing job of revealing the awakening gifts from a gemat-gemate pairing. Once I got a grasp on the dynamic, it was okay for the plot to charge ahead.Prime Obsession is a fast-paced space opera outfitted in shiny new gadgets and modern characters.  If you're looking for a sci-fi novel brimming with loads of techno jargon, intergalactic intrigue and angst, you've come to the right place.  Melina and Wulf's chemistry decimates small planets.  The ""foreplay"" preceding their first time together behind closed doors covers way too much ground; it dangled on the storyline string a tad longer than I would have preferred.  The romance and dialogue occasionally feels dated, although I could appreciate some truly cute moments.  Monette Michaels' narrative style is clean and precise with crisp visuals that flow easily from scene to scene.  All in all, it's fun to be kept on the edge of your seat for the bulk of the ride.  That's no easy feat in a story with so many subplots and secondary characters.  If this is just the first installment, then the next episode will have to put in some major overtime to keep up.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"

2321,4,"This book made me laugh, cry and feel heartbroken all at the same time. A couple of parts were drawn out and dare I say boring, but regardless of that it was still a really good book."
2322,4,"This is a quick read so I didn't get as much time to enjoy the characters as I would like and it felt a bit rushed, but overall very enjoyable"
2323,5,"I have noticed many romance titles featured in Scotland.  Was it the skirts on the men?  Bagpipes?  Haggis (no, no, no) this is the story that will transport you to another world with people who feel as we do.  I don't like to repeat the story but I will tell you that I had such a sense of satisfaction and happiness after reading this skillfully written tale.  High recommended."
2324,3,"I never like leaving a bad review because I know this book is the creation of someone who worked very hard to write it.  However, it really lacked anything truly new.  I guess the concept of how a werewolf is ""activated"" is a bit novel, but the plot and simplicity of the story prevented me from giving it a higher rating.  It was very short and everything magically ""all worked out in the end"" with little development of the characters.  I am sorry to say that I do not plan to read anymore more books in this series."
2325,5,"The author calls this story bit unpleasant and he is right. It is, however a masterpiece showing Fitzgerald's' talent to its full. Seldom one reads stories that just appear in front of him with all their nuances, effects of mild intoxication and, perhaps, a serious mental disease.I was considering to re-read the Great Gatsby but I am glad I chose this book of shorter stories instead. Great reading!All five stars and highly recommended."

2328,4,"I wasn't sure if I would like this book or not. I mean, it's got an unusual premise and I thought it might be a little too much like poorly done Yaoi. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I did like it, very much.Diana and her friend/traveling companion have been abducted by the raedjour, Dark Elves. Against their will the sorcerer has placed the spell on them to turn them into their kind. These elves are highly sexual, created to be consorts of a goddess, and only male children are ever born. Thus they need human women to breed with and to turn into the raedjour.Diana has spent months being passed around for the men to discover if she is their truemate and bear their children. Needless to say, Diana isn't a big fan of this. She knows she can't stop feeling the lust, it's part of the elves' allure, but she still fights against every man. Until Commander Salin. Actually, she fights him too. ;-) Diana is pretty impressive in her stubbornness and sheer will. She drives Salin crazy and, because he's perfect for her, he infuriates her, too. At least until their very explosive time together.This was a fun and very sexy read. Something I'll probably read again."
2329,4,"We all know about the conspiracy theories around the JFK assasination. There's more than you can count. Contained in this story is a great fictional version of what may have happened.The two main characters are reporters who are looking for a good story but soon find themselves in way over their heads. I'd like to write more about what they uncover while working on their story and the dangers they encounter while doing so, but I don't want to give away any major plot points. Part of the fun of reading a book like this is discovering things as you turn the pages and I don't want to spoil anyone else's fun.I'll just say this: There's enough good suspense and action in this novel that I kept turning the pages and had a hard time putting my Kindle down until I got to the last page. It's a very compelling story and the author did a great job with it.This was the first book I read by author Dave Conifer. After reading it, I definitely want to read more by him."
2330,3,I did manage to finish the book but I did have trouble reading it. The storyline was not too bad & the characters were good though. I thought that if the book was shorter it would have been better. It rambled on a bit like I am now. If the price is right it is worth a look.
2331,5,I enjoyed reading this book.  It has romance and wonderful intimate sexual  encounters throughout the book.  And they are described in detail without using nasty or vulgar language.  These stories are filled with suspense and intrigues that keep your attention.  Susan Mallory is a good author.
2332,5,"Moves like one of the classics. Good plot.  Good writing.  If you like stories about successful underdogs, this is your book."
2333,2,"I am not from Washington, but enjoy good media.  Unfortuntely, the Washington Post is mostly about politics, or the Redskins and other local stories pertient only to Washington DC.  Whereas the NY Times is more international, and the Wall Street Journal is very business oriented but at least national, the Wash. Post is very narrow.  I unsubscribed."
2334,3,"Interesting for the historic value- not really a story, rather an accounting of the events. Interesting biographical  information in the 1st person."
2335,5,"yummy dirty smut to read. I'm talking full on smut. m/m/m m/f everyone's inhibitions are done. Definitely one to put in your memory bank.It does has a story, but it is about the detailed sex scenes the author creates for you. They are longer than a typical romance book. This book isn't very long, but if you like smut, this will become one of your favorites."
2336,2,I didn't understand this short story and I didn't like it. It was just too strange and too graphic for my taste.
2337,4,"Simple writing, compelling store.  My one complaint is that the author uses the word ""simply"" to much.  A suprising page turner though!"
2338,5,"As with the other Doan and Carstairs books, this one is funny, witty and smart and I enjoyed it from start to finish.  The author knew how to create three-dimensional characters that you enjoy reading about and following along. And Carstairs is the star of the show! Rarely do I really like the trick of adding an animal into a story and making them the smartest of the bunch but Doan and Carstairs are true partners with their quirks and personalities. It was a pleasure to read and I'm only sad that there aren't more of them."
2339,4,"Although I'm usually not into to the stereotypical soft butch seducing the straight femme scenario, the sex scenes in this story were very hot.  The power issue between student and teacher is always a huge turn on for me and that both women were above the age of consent made this a short story a guiltless pleasure. My only issue regarding this story was its brevity. This story is about a 20 minute read.  I also preferred this story over Paisley Smith's other story, First Taste, which was much shorter and totally forgettable."
2340,4,Good story.  Likable characters and believable story.  Was glue to it until the ending.  it had its ups and down and real emotions within the characters.
2341,1,done in poor taste rough thoughtless not a bit of romantic just raunchy and distasteful. ugh I was looking for more
2342,5,Sometimes it takes two.... Awesome story line..  Disheartening to see how some women think that taking a beating somehow shows love.  Chris is a lucky  lady to have found not one but two men to love her unconditionally.
2343,3,"Meh. That was pretty much how I felt about this one. The writing was okay, the characters were okay. Everything was . . . just okay.It could have been a whole lot more.I liked the whole premise. Young innocent man kicked out of his house must turn to being a whore at a place called the Chicken Ranch to survive, and his first client is a shy hunk with a stutter. So far so good. And the first part of this was nice; I liked the initial scene between the two of them.But from there, things remained relatively flat. Young sets up this hunky but nerdy guy with a stutter, but in the entire book I think he only stutters once, and it&#8217;s not really a problem. I wanted to see more drama, more tension, just more than a saccharin-sweet tale. That&#8217;s pretty much what the book was. There weren&#8217;t really any levels other than one fight, and I never really felt much for the characters. So much potential for inner struggles, but it just wasn&#8217;t there.So if you want a low stress, sweet romance, you&#8217;ll enjoy this. But if you&#8217;re looking for something with more substance and grit, this isn&#8217;t the book I&#8217;d recommend. A nice diversion for an afternoon, and that&#8217;s about it."
2344,4,"The DC adapter cable is very short and coiled.  The picture isn't accurate.  Eyeball estimate of length is two feet.  It will stretch to most front-seats in cars/trucks but if your device is big, like a tablet, you might end up having to put your tablet on the floor of the car/truck.The AC adapter is about three feet in length.  The short length might be a problem if your power strip is behind or under a desk or hard to reach.  You might have to make alternate arrangements.I originally purchased these for a Kindle Fire but since learned that Gomadic has custom power cables for the Kindle Fire.  When I asked Gomadic about it, they took the time to explain things.  The Kindle Fire requires a higher current, 2A v/s 1A.  These chargers will work with the Kindle Fire but you might not get a rapid charge as expected.  Also, the AC adapter might get warm during the charging process.BTW, Gomadic sent me a free Kindle Fire AC adapter.  Seriously.  I didn't even ask for it.

2345,5,"In Balance of Fate, Jeff Inlo completed his Delver Magic Trilogy. It is as consistently fascinating and captivating as the rest of this trilogy. We see the sorcerous, Tabris, turn to the dark side, still blaming Ryson for her decisions. Most interesting in this volume is Inlo's ability to mix philosophy with a fascinating story. It was the most philosophical of the three books. I suspect, though, that without these discussions, Enin's inaction would be really frustrating. In the end, though, he finds his balance. Lief, Matthew, Enin and Ryson all met their fates - some went to their rewards in the afterlife, some continued on. It's a wonderful story. I'll miss these characters now that the trilogy is over. We'll have to see if Inlo has any plans to take them further."
2346,5,"Alexa Daniels never dreamed that the gorgeous leather clad Harley rider that she had a roadside tryst with a few weeks ago would end up being Justin Winston with Winston Industries.  She was completely thrown for a curve when she faced him knowing this was the man she was presenting a proposal to on behalf of Therber Management Services.  She couldn't believe that he didn't even acknowledge meeting her before, and even told her he was pleased to meet her.  This presentation was too important, so she put on her game face and went on.  Alexa wasn't going to let him ruin this for her with his cruel games.When the meeting concluded, Alexa couldn't get out of there fast enough after confronting Justin about their steamy encounter.  She raced home to cool off, but as she gathered her briefcase from the car, a man grabbed her from behind and jabbed a gun in her back.  She tried to struggle and get away, but he had her.  Alexa thought it was over until someone came to help in response to her screams for help.  The next thing she knew she was in another car with a rugged looking Justin tending to her wounds, and the intense businessman she had just met driving.  She demanded to know what was going on, and was flabbergasted to learn she was in the presence of Jason and Justin Winston - twin brothers.What a steamy suspenseful ride!!  There is story with intense passion, and together that always makes a winner.  Jason is a strong controlled dominant man while his twin is laid back taking things moment by moment.  Jason and Justin know immediately that Alexa was the woman for them, but she has been hurt in the past, and isn't as easily convinced."
2347,4,"Every book I read and love resonates with me. As I'm sure it does for others who enjoy a good book. This one, as I read it, made me think of my relationship with my husband and the power of a transcendent love.Summary: The sight of the red door saves Colin Baxter in his dream, but very quickly a man appears and the dream becomes a thing of raw sexual need with a person Colin can't identify. He just knows the man needs him, and Colin aches to find and heal his lover...even if the man doesn't really exist.Marek Donovan just wants to be left alone to lick his wounds and recover from a terrible loss. The rundown house in Fiji suits his minimal needs just fine. He doesn't want to face the world again, and on a small, secluded island figures he's safe from everyone and everything. Particularly guilt from his past.Dreams of this nameless man and his house plague Colin for two years, but he's come to care about his phantom lover so deeply he doesn't want them to end. Then Colin visits Fiji and comes face-to-face with the house from his visions, prompting him to believe these dreams just might be his destiny.Colin knocks on the door, determined to find answers.What I liked about this book: This is one of the Cameron Dane books that is not just smoking hot but grips your heart, clenches it in a tight fist and doesn't let go from start to finish! I have to admit that I had a harder time reading this one than the other books because it deals with such a huge loss and the pain that guilt from losing someone you love because of your own pride causes and I was not prepared emotionally to delve into that quagmire.But Marek and Colin kept drawing me to their story and with every step into their budding and troubled relationship, I fell deeper into the hope of their ""happily ever after"". Cameron Dane has that wonderful ability to not just make the characters come to life, but their raw emotions slam into you with such fierceness, you find yourself gasping and verbally outing yourself while reading her books in public."
2348,5,I was prepared to laugh but I was not prepared for this book to bring tears to my eyes. It was such a fun spin on the traditional Scrooge story but completely it's own bit of fun!
2349,3,"Overall, I enjoyed this book but it wasn't all that original.  The writing was good, which is something I've come to treasure in today's market, when anyone can publish their poorly written slop without much difficulty and even best selling authors from major publishing houses are suffering a lack of editing.  For that reason alone, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes paranormal/Gothic romance.If you're not looking for characters with depth or a plot with surprising twists, you'll probably enjoy this book.There were two things that I didn't like.  (SPOILER ALERT!)  First, the way the love scenes were written gave me the impression that this author isn't really comfortable writing about sex.  When the hero and heroine made love for the first time, the tone suddenly became weirdly formal, with lines like ""It seemed imperative that their bodies meet without hindrance..."" which sort of killed the mood for me.  There were also so many flagrant metaphors (""He stirred her...like waves of a storm""; ""They poised on the edge of a volcano..."") that I totally missed the ghostly elements during that scene because I thought it was just more metaphor.  It was only at the end of the scene, when the characters started talking about what had just happened, that I even understood what the author was trying to portray.Second, I'm a retired professional musician who also has a degree in psychology, and unfortunately, this author tried to portray both a musician character and a character who suffers mental problems without doing enough research into either area.  Most people who lack my background might not notice, but for me, these flaws were glaring.  I'm not certain how this author came up with her information, but it was both inaccurate and outdated.  I realize it's nerdy to expect writers to do a little basic research before they start typing, but this kind of sloppiness tends to ruin books for me.  I can handle a bit of poetic license, but this went beyond that, straight into the realm of lazy disregard for plausibility.One other complaint: most ebooks allow the reader to jump between chapters.  This one didn't, making it very difficult to move through the book if I wanted to go back and check something I'd read before--something I often do while reading a book which involves some sort of mystery.  This really annoyed me, more than the occasion errors in the formatting did.If you're not too picky and don't expect too much, you'll probably enjoy this book.  It's not a bad way to kill an afternoon if you have nothing better to do."
2350,5,Amazing!!! This book kept you wanting more! I didn't want to put it down!!! I WILL read all Jim Richard novels I come across.
2351,5,"This could have just as well been titled The Incredible Journey. The cast of characters is small and nicely developed, especially Capt. Nemo, the heartless man with a heart. Be prepared for some serious underwater descriptions of flora and fauna which can bog down the story. There is also some incriminating statements of how man was treating the planet in Verne's day that doesn't seem to have changed much."
2352,5,"My husband and I realy enjoy these Henry Wright novels.  Good writing, great characters, and sensible plots make these a great series."
2353,5,I love the Leather and Lace series. They are really well written stories with depth to them. You can feel the love between the characters which make the romance very believable. Branded is yet another victory. Thumbs up and highly recommended.
2354,5,"IT takes moxy, gumption, and a bit of thrill for black and whites to really appreciate the characters and their nuances.  Not so overly written or stuck in prose.  Humor slices the book apart in witty ways that makes me wish the characters were people I knew.  So well written that upon finishing it I just bought the next book!!"
2355,5,"this book just cracked me up. There is a tradition in theater about the 4th wall - where the audience sits. Usually the audience is ignored. Well, the author keeps violating the 4th wall concept in the book. He writes these outrageous disclaimers. ""No characters have been harmed in the writing of this book well except for the ones who are dead. But there were dead anyway"" and stuff like that.I kept wanting someone to read parts out loud to, and I was alone. well, except for the author but he already knew what he wrote..."
2356,4,"I really liked the MC narrator James.  He was a man who had made mistakes - and continued to make them - but was fairly self aware.  I have loved Dickens since high school, so the story about the &#34;missing&#34; Christmas story was fascinating and Josh Lanyon did a wonderful job of weaving portions/excerpts from that (fictitious) book into his own.  I never realized what a market there is for rare books.  As usual, Lanyon's writing is flawless.  I always enjoy his style.  James' neighbor was an endearing (although sometimes annoying character) and watching James take to her, despite himself, was a sweet touch.  And the glow-in-the-dark, flavored condoms were awesome.  I do wish the story hadn't ended so abruptly; I did not have enough interaction between James and Sedgewick to fully believe in their love/HEA."
2357,3,"A retired small-town sheriff moves to Palm springs & &#34;profiles&#34; for the FBI & the local police chief, his friend.  A surprising ending."
2358,5,Love books that combine a bit of history and a glimpse of another culture with the elements of mystery.  Would buy another book by this author.
2359,4,The love that they share is so sexy! Not to mention it introduces us to more hot Navy Seals. Can't wait to read more from this series.
2360,5,"Another one I need to add to my can't believe I waited so long to read this list. It picks up the pace quickly and moves right along until the end.Gabriel is kind of a cocky ass at times, but once you learn more about him, it is hard not to like him. He is a total wiseass and had me chuckling out loud more than once.Antonio is one hell of a sexy Spaniard. I loved his way of speaking and could almost hear that sexy accent whispering in my ear. He and Gabriel are smoking together and comploment each other perfectly.I would read more about these two any time."
2361,4,"Apparently this is a prequel to the series.  I have read nothing of the series but bought the ""Lords of the Underworld"" bundle that has this book and the first three books.  I read a reviewer's note that said if you get the sample of this bundle that you will get the entire short story/prequel in that sample (word to the wise).  Of course that would only be helpful for people who have read the rest of the series and didn't want to buy the prequel.  For me, I just decided to delve into this series so I didn't mind getting it in the bundle.It has some pretty low reviews.  Normally I would never buy and probably wouldn't read a book or novella that has 3 stars.  I am pretty surprised it has such low reviews, but perhaps people were hoping for more from this prequel.This story is about the guardian to the gates of Hell (Geryon) and the goddess of oppression, Kadence who is in charging of maintaining the wall between the human realm and Hell.  The wall has a crack in it and Kadence bargains with Lucifer to allow Geryon to help her repair it.  Only the very end does it bring up Pandora's box (from what I can gather, the point of the story was to give us the background on Pandora's box, but I am not sure if Geryon or Kadence play any role in the rest of the books).I plan to read the next book, The Darkest Night next.  Here I go..."
2362,4,This is one hot read. I really enjoyed it. If you like stories about werewolves and hot sex then this is the story for you. It is the first in a series of four stories. I think you'll like this one and you will want to read the other three in the series also.
2363,4,"Is a powerful story about bullying and the consequences that occur to the victims. This book was written because something haunted the author's core about the Columbine School killing. The killers' young teenagers themselves were displayed as evil monsters and not given any forgiveness for their horrific actions of injuring and killing innocent victims. This reader is neutral and not looking to debate with anyone about the terrible incident. This reader brought up this sensitive topic because this story is a warning and should be read and discuss with all silent crying out victims and the bullies to bring the truth to the light. Not all are innocent when a psychopath is created.This book was written to see the world through the victim's eyes and how he was affected by the constant taunting and teasing and the lies he experienced every day. School became a torture chamber and he tried to let the adults in his life know that he hatred every moment being in an institution and be bullied by mindless insensitive jerks. I as a mother and substitute teacher know the signs when a child becomes phobia and fights like a demon to not go to school; it is a plea for help. That the children are being destroy by cruel intents be it physically or psychological abuse by his peers and will do everything in their power to protect themselves and become strangers under your own roof to not experience one more hatred name or label. These taunts paint a self -image and the child starts to believe she/he are stupid, retarded and other vile labels.This author plotted a dark fantasy with criminal intent to get the message across that bully is the worst damage anyone could experience, it lingers long after the bully moves on with their lives and not realizing the aftermath of their intents. It is very graphic and my stomach almost came up with some of the details. This story is out there but with some of the bullies today this message needs to be declared. Reading this book will definitely open up many eyes and minds to the destruction of an innocent child that was forced to turn into a Dr. Hyde and JekyllIn the author's words; ""His heart felt blacker than night, empty, soulless, cold. Unfixable,bleeding, damaged to the optimal degree. There was no going back to any former life, any former sanity. This was the end of it all, the end of him. His cries were so loud, he could not hear the television. Muffy was standing by his feet, licking his pant leg to try and ease his anguish.""""I'm the bull's-eye in the sights of millions. Put me in a room with a million people, I'm the only target. They can sense it. Are there others like me? All this time, people are afraid of Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Ed Gein but are they mentally disturbed? Is that why they kill people? Are they crazy? How can they be? Society targets them for no apparent reason before they take a single life.""Society, in turn, creates its own monsters.""""The most brutal novel ever written!""This book has mature content, language and details that should be review before letting underage children read it. There is a vital message in the pages and is definitely an eye opener. There are few editing concerns but the story is powerful but they do not distract the reader."
2364,5,"Sexy, suspenseful, adventurous and always surprising, Hell Bent has it all. I could not stop reading this story- every chapter pushed me further down the edge of my seat! The plot is full of non-stop action from the start, triggered by a murder and exploding with mystery. Annabelle is an all-star heroine: a smart, stubborn, witty, and completely relatable woman thrown into a world of assassins and conspiracy.And Jack is...Wow.Dark, dangerous, sexy, protective, and utterly mouth watering- he brings the complexity of `right' and `wrong' to a new level. Hell Bent is an absolute must read!!"
2365,2,"The book was good but it was kind of bland and boring. It could of used more snapshots and thought shots. To me it was  snack book, it would be good for ten year olds."
2366,5,I think I have this one in both book and audio. It is a good story either way. good ol' Maul.
2367,4,"Mail order bride, Clarissa, is running from her past and seeking a fresh start in the west. Logan and Derek, long-time friends and business partners, are seeking to share a mail order bride wife. I loved this plot and all three main characters were almost immediately endearing. Both men clearly cared about Clarissa and deeply wanted to give her a good life with the both of them. There were a few parts where the dialogue was a little cheesy and I noticed a few spelling/editing errors, but not too bad. I look forward to reading the rest of this series."
2368,4,"As a lifelong Christian (I was raised in a Christian home, was saved at 8 yrs old, never known a time in my life where I didn't know Jesus) I've experienced some very hurtful things in churches in the past. The church I was saved in had a business meeting in order to fire one of the pastors. My parents supported all the pastors but we were in the minority. The meeting became very heated until finally we had to run out of the sanctuary. People became ugly fast and chased us, even shooting a gun into the air in the church sanctuary. They literally ran us out of town. We moved and my parents joined the First Baptist Church but didn't attend church very much and finally not at all. They didn't lose their faith in Jesus Christ but they lost faith in the church (and my Mom was the daughter of a minister). As a teenager, I began attending a small church with some friends but the older people of the congregation resented being overrun with teenagers. It disrupted their placid spiritual life so they fired the preacher and all the teens left that church. My husband and I joined a church in 1983 and attended until 2009. We were very active. But of all the pastors that went through our church, I could probably count on one hand the ones that didn't abuse the congregation in one way or another. Finally, we had a straw-that-broke-the-camels'-back event and we left our church. Needless to say I'm gun shy now! We've been visiting churches all over our town but haven't found a match yet. I think I might like one but only to get anxious that we would invest our time, money and selves into a body that has the same problems. It takes awhile before you get to know the church, policies, leadership, congregants enough to know if all is well or something is rotten in Denmark. I had almost made up my mind to be like my parents and just drop out of the church scene and worship God in my own way. Then I read this book. I think the book's description is right on the mark so I won't repeat it. But, since I started reading this book, we've started visiting more churches and praying that we find one soon."

Her editor, Ross Philips, suggests she try a new genre to get her out of her depression.Ross Philips will do whatever it takes to get Julia out of her funk, even if it involves a little erotic research.Will Julia be able to see Ross as anything more than a friend and editor?  Can Ross convince Julia it's more than just research?  Will their friendship survive?Erotic Research is a wonderful debut novel by Mari Carr.  The emotion and passion of this story is brilliant.  The first kiss was wonderful and, as the tension built to that final exploration, the anticipation was delightful.  Julia broke my heart with her struggles in love and Ross is just the man to help her take a chance on it.Erotic Research is a story of tingling goodness!  I didn't know that helping keep someone warm would be that hot.  The innocence of that scene was scorching on so many levels.  The slowly-built passion between Julia and Ross was excellent.  I was left with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes, which is why I am Joyfully Recommending Erotic Research.  I can't wait to see what Ms. Carr with do with her next story.Jambreareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
2370,1,"It's hard to say enough bad things about this book.  If you need it spelled out, it's free.  Just remember you will never get back the time you spent reading it.Mine went straight to the dead end archives."
2371,5,"I've been quietly trying to craft a solid, effective query letter for more than 5 years. I've invested in several books, several by literary agents, none of whom expressed what I needed to hear as logically and to the point as Mr. Lukeman's 76 page guide.  If you're attempting to add ""published author"" to your bio, then immediately download this amazing gift.  Whether you understand what you're attempting to accomplish in your writing, or not, this small booklet will make you a better writer, and maybe even, a represented, published one."
2372,5,"I loved the relationship between the h and H.  It is a rarity to have a couple in a story actually like each other from start to finish without any ""Big Misunderstandings"".  I can't say I am like the heroine, but some of the things that popped up in her internal monologue were the types of things that rattle about my own head, so that was fun too.  The sex was definitely adventurous and hot, but with a sweet aspect to it that is also frequently missing from a lot of books I have read lately.  It doesn't feel like something written out of a manual, but how you might actually expect two people who have just fallen for each other to behave. I loved the fact that the romantic scenes weren't wrapped up in descriptions of how gigantic the manly parts are or how teensy the lady bits are. Refreshing after Lisa Marie Rice (who I love, but the descriptions of people's privates gets a tad repetitive). Anyway...I highly recommend this one."

Eve goes to male strip club for her birthday.  Guess who dances for her birthday.
2374,5,"These series is for those that enjoy non-stop action military fiction. I enjoy these book, although nobody ever dies, they just keep changing helicopters, once, twice, three times in just the first two books. But then again, these are FICTION stories. Anyway, try one of the series and you will get hooked."
2375,4,"Playing to Win. Shelley MunroReview from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.So, in the mood for a straight romance I chose this. Its a romance, and also a puzzle with danger coming to Kate along with the solution.I liked Kate, she's mum to her dead sister's child, and she and Jamie have carved out a contented life for themselves. Then their world is turned upside down when tabloid papers print a story over Jamie being local hero and rugby player Lane's son. Of course as always they're not interested in the truth &#8211; just want scandal for the ratings. Kate is bombarded with Press at her home, Lane completely blind sided by the fact he may have a ten year old child, and Jamie struggling with insecurity wondering if he'll be taken from Kate...Kate's firm and insistent, nothing will take him away from her, though she's willing to let Lane build a relationship with him.Along the journey to the truth there's  a potential kidnapping, danger and attacks on Kate&#8217;s home and business, and threats to her safety. Lane steps up his protection of her and gradually falls in love. He just needs to persuade Jamie and Kate that they should be a family.Its a fun romance with a snippet of danger, not heart stopping but a more subtle kind that creeps up quietly and lands with a bang. The police were great characters too, becoming regular visitors. The protagonist didn't really come as a shock to me, but it was well done, and everything added up &#8211; I hate when we find out who the &#8220;baddie&#8221; is and it doesn&#8217;t fit the clues we've had, none of that here though. Looking back we can see how things build up to that dramatic climax and reveal.Priced at 0.99 for 228 pages its long enough to let the reader get into the plot. Its a bargain for lovers of gentle contemporary romance.Stars: Four, fun read but a one off for me.ARC supplied by Netgalley"
2376,5,"I loved this story.  I thought the Author pulled it altogether so well.  I liked how comfortable these people were with themselves and how protective they were of ""Amber Eyes""...this she panther.  Such an incredible, well thought out story."
2377,5,this was my first book from this author and I quite enjoyed it.  The sexual tension between the 2 characters and his friend was hot.  The sex was hot.  You just fall in love with the characters from the start.  It was a short story but it was a great one.
2378,5,"I love this series! I can't say enough about this book.  It was even better than the first.  I started the third book the minute I finished this one and it is a page turner as well. Thank you, Ty Johnston for an original piece of work!"
2379,4,"THE AMAZON'S CURSE is part of Gena Showalter's Atlantis series and probably should be read after THE VAMPIRE'S BRIDE.

2380,2,"CRISS CROSS (PsyCop #2) by Jordan Castillo Price.Vic has too many wimpy characteristics.  He always wants to get high.  He takes double doses of his medicine and other drugs to feel better.  Much of the time he is incompetent because he is in a haze.  You'd think that since he's been seeing ghosts for most of his life, he'd be used to it and have ways to deal with it.  But no, he's freaking out all the time trying to run away from every ghost he sees.  The reason he's a psycop is because he can talk to ghosts.  I was disappointed that he didn't use that skill in either of the first two books.  But to be fair he does talk to one or two ghosts briefly in each book - but not related to solving a case.Second, in addition to running away from ghosts, he runs away from people - his friends, his acquaintances, his lover.  He buys crystals to help him with a problem, but then he runs away from the guy without knowing how to use them.  Later he must return to the guy to ask how to use the crystals.  A ghost tells him how (which may or may not be true), so Vic runs away from the guy again without getting instructions.  When others ask Vic how things are, he lies and says fine so they will go away and leave him alone.  This did not interest me.  It frustrated me.  Experts say ""don't write about wimps.""  I agree.  Vic is a wimp.Vic leaves his phone turned off, so when friends try to reach him, they can't.  He intends to tell Jacob (his lover) about a problem, but he wimps out and doesn't tell him.  When Jacob starts to talk about something, Vic says ""Do we have to talk about it right this second?""  Again, running away.Later when some bad guys are caught and the cops are asking Vic for details, Vic doesn't tell them that the bad guys have other safe houses.  I did not like his reason.  Some might say the reason was stupid.  Others might say he had a believable motive for keeping the secret, but he didn't act on it.  So his lying to the cops was for nothing.I really liked the relationship with Jacob.  It's hot.  Jacob is so intense and into Vic.  It's too bad the surrounding story was weak.DATA:Narrative mode: first person Vic.  Kindle count story length: 2078 (314 KB).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.  Sexual language: moderate.  Number of sex scenes: 3, including rear door activity.  Setting: current day mostly Chicago, Illinois.  Copyright: 2006.  Genre: erotic gay male paranormal romance."
2381,3,"Twilight in the Spaces BetweenEditing is terrible and interferes with reading flow.  Foul language and prejudicial sentiments expressed.  Twilight has more than it's share of perversion, rage and hate.  There are many ""babies of rabies"" in this tale.  Only a cleansing fire can make it right.Text contains contradictory imaging (""Five years of bone dry summers and rainy seasons without rain has turned Kisatchie into kindling waiting for the match.""  ""Andrea steps to the edge of the platform and looks down to see her reflection in an oily pool of water."")  This is only one example of inattention to detail.  There is absolutely genius imaging (""...the basketball hits the asphalt, the sound is like a fist striking flesh"" creating a visceral image and completely clueless imaging such as ""An impossible sun...wasted sky..."".  What exactly does that mean?The protagonists are both victims and are trying to find ways to make the suffering go away--opposite sides of the same coin.  Even though the disorganization of the story--multiple characters continually switch with one another between the present and the past--reflects the mental state of both Clive and Andrea, it makes the story very hard to follow.  When Andrea finds transportation to Twilight the sounds she hears, the body she finds, and the location of the car are completely lost as the story progresses.The story is jerky making it hard to read, but the phrasing is vivid drawing you in.  This novel has a split personality and actually reads like two rather than one author.  One author I would read again, the other one I can live without.Definitely a book you will not soon forget!"
2382,3,"This book was 73 pages on my Nook, but for a short story a lot of detail was packed into it.  It definately gave me an interest in the rest of the series.  I loved that Robyn was deaf.  I think that was so different from any other book.  I really liked that Robyn and Keil were equals.  Overall a good quick read."
2383,3,"3.5 stars for this short, enjoyable, explicit romance.  Tropes include revenge, abandonment, and insta-love. It's cloaked as science fiction, but it's ROMANCE. As such, it's just fine, but I much prefer Andrews' straight-up urban fantasies. It's not that I dislike romance -- sometimes that's exactly what I want (but not from Team Andrews).This is book 1 of the Kinsmen series. Book 2 is out, too. My main problem with Silent Blade is the insta-love trope. It didn't work for me, so then the sex didn't move me either. The relationship development relied on sex too much, maybe? I am guessing the length (42 pages) constrained the authors.Setting: Another world, inhabited by humans with special implants and ruled by a few different  Kinsman  or  Kin  families who have special inborn powers. (Think Mafia families ruling their financial empires, killing off the competition.)Characters: The hero (Celino Carvannas) is a rich and ruthless Kinsman, good with knives, 32 years old, ""tall, lean, and overwhelmingly masculine"" (of course). The heroine (Meli Galdes) is an outcast Kinsman, excised from her family, and -- because of her ability to slay instantly with an energy ribbon -- she has become a world-class assassin.Plot: Meli's family asked her to do one last killing for them (even though she's been excised for 12 years, she still does their dirty work??) Celino is the target. We are never told exactly WHY they want him dead, but I suppose it's because his business is outperforming their business.But there's a twist to this assassination assignment. She knows her target. She was only 10 when their joint parents, seeking to combine power, arranged for the two to become engaged. He was 16. She studied him, as a good wife-in-waiting should do in this feudal society, and in the course of learning, she crushed, pinning all her hopes and dreams on him. But at age 22 (to her 16) he broke the engagement -- not kindly or tactfully at all -- causing her to become untouchable, an outcast, eventually an assassin.When they meet again 12 years later he doesn't recognize her, because she was always veiled in the past. Insta-luv! He strode into the kitchen in the restaurant, smelled her passion cones (talkin' biscuits!), saw her lush curves, met her rich coffee-brown eyes...After he left, Meli smiled with satisfaction. ""It took almost 18 years, from the skinny 10-year-old girl to the 28-year old woman, but Mother proved right. She hit him like a brick.""So....will she kill him, or won't she? Will he figure out that she's the girl he tossed to the curb? If so, will he suffer and grovel?  (I do like a good grovel).Not much action. Minimal suspense. Not much to make it qualify as sci-fi or paranormal. This is a romance novel, with explicit sex and several  references to honey and breasts. The language is clean. Not much violence. Nothing gory."
2384,5,Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover. Announcing it to her husband over breakfast probably wasn't the way to begin this adventure.Victoria Alexander has a way of making me laugh that no one else does! The antics of this husband and wife are truely hilarious. She really doesn't want a lover - just her husband's attention. He really doesn't want her to take a lover - but he offers to help. They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!
2385,5,"I enjoyed this book because it lets us look into another time in our past history.  Also I am an older reader and this takes me back to a time closer to the way we were.  Far from perfect but much more genteel with manners sometimes to a fault, plus the influence of the Christian Way again far from perfect but much better than now, as far as I am concerned. Since I am closer to 80 than 70 I have lived from before WWII until now and I wish we would return back, at least to the idea that &#34;using vulgar words was for vulgar people&#34; that most people had no respect for and avoided whenever possible.  popcorngranny"
2386,1,"this book is a good read, but not at this price.  I am a very avid reader and have read a lot of books by Bella Andre, however there is no way anyone should pay this price for a paperback with 300 pages.  Her other recently released books are too expensive as well at over $8.  Believe there are a tremendous number of great writers equal to or better and at 25-0% of the cost."

So while she strikes a deal with Wesley for a place in her bed, she doesn't know but she also gave him access to her heart. The war isn't over though and Wesley fears losing another woman to childbirth while Carrie is terrified of losing another man to the war. They both lose their hearts in the end. Very good sensual read, another triumph for Ms Glass."
2388,4,"I can't understand all of the 1 star reviews complaining that it stops right when the story is getting good. The author plainly states in the product description that this is a novella prequel to three full length novels already written. The point is to get a reader hooked so they will spend the money to buy the full length book. And I was definitely hooked. I just finished the novella and immediately bought My Soul to Take. The writing is good, the authors hooks you into the story quickly, and even though the story is about a teenage girl and probably written for young adults, I think it is a good summer read for adults. Something that is an easy read with a page turning plot. My personal favorite 1star review complains that there is too much description for the plot. Ummm, okay. If this is too much description, than the plot of the entire Twilight series can be summed up in less than a paragraph. And Harry Potter in a page. That is the point of a novel. The author should draw you into the world they have created through their descriptions. You should be in Lakeside with Kaylee, smell the hospital smells and feel her confusion and frustrations. This author does a fantastic job of this. So far, I am a fan and I look forward to reading the full length novels."

2390,4,"This is very different from what I typically read, but I found it really interesting and very well written.  The writing really grabbed me.  This is not a pick me up, feel good story.  It's dark all the time and violence is scattered throughout, but the story line flows and the writing is so good I read it in one sitting.  I'd recommend It."

2392,4,"If what you want is hot steamy vampire guys and juicy menage and M/M sex, this is the perfect short read.  I was ready to shove the heroine out of the way and take her place.There's also some great description of the old theatre in London where the vampire sex club is located.Weaknesses - not much of a story.  Nissa is conveniently orphaned and doesn't have a job or any ties to the mortal world she'd regret abandoning, so there's little conflict for her, nor, so it seems, for the vampire Hex she bonds with.  Set in London 2069, we really don't get to look around the place much; most of the action takes place in very luxurious beds.  Or showers.This was not an issue for me.  I was looking for a chocolate truffle kind of read, not a full meal, so I savored every bite.  If you are looking for something longer/deeper/with an intricate plot, you may be disappointed."

2398,4,"Three novels, only one of which involves Pirates or Buccaneers.  Occurs on Venus - no space travel, done by mental telepathy.  This is such a clone of the ERB style that it is unsurprising that he was allegedly outraged by it as a hijacking of the John Carter of Mars books.  That said it is so very like him that one wonders if he didn't write it under a pseudonym so that he could complain about it publicly and get free publicity for the stories.  Strong heroes, beautiful heroines adventure, danger, frustrated love that succeeds in the end - does this sound familiar.  Better than many of ERB's stories but not as good as his best.  Good period reading appropriately priced for Kindle."
2399,4,"This was a quick read- 3 chapters  but had me riveted.  Graphic content is probably not going to be for everyone.  The story is about two serial killers and the tale is a cautionary one.  Don't hitch a ride because the person who might pick you up could be a psychopath, and don't pick up hitchers because he/she might be a psychopath.But what happens when one serial killer picks up another?  An enticing freebie for the kindle!I loved the collaboration effect- the two voices were distinct but not jarringly so and added interest to the writing.  I wouldn't want to be in a car with EITHER of these serial killers!!What it boils down to is if you like a bit of a thrill, can stomach the macabre and like to see a couple of very bad people get what's coming to them- you'll enjoy this quick and riveting read.  If you have a weak stomach for mayhem and madness, don't bother downloading it.One thing: I would love to see more from these authors as the characters really did come to life in a very short span of time and to me that signals good writing, even if the content isn't palatable to everyone."
